	abstract = {The way in which a frictional interface fails is critical to our fundamental understanding of failure processes in fields ranging from engineering to the study of earthquakes. Frictional motion is initiated by rupture fronts that propagate within the thin interface that separates two sheared bodies. By measuring the shear and normal stresses along the interface, together with the subsequent rapid real-contact-area dynamics, we find that the ratio of shear stress to normal stress can locally far exceed the static-friction coefficient without precipitating slip. Moreover, different modes of rupture selected by the system correspond to distinct regimes of the local stress ratio. These results indicate the key role of nonuniformity to frictional stability and dynamics with implications for the prediction, selection, and arrest of different modes of earthquakes.},

	abstract = {Frictional processes entail the rupture of the ensemble of discrete contacts defining a frictional interface. There are a variety of views on how best to describe the onset of dry frictional motion. These range from modelling friction with a single degree of freedom, a 'friction coefficient', to theoretical treatments using dynamic fracture to account for spatial and temporal dynamics along the interface. We investigated the onset of dry frictional motion by performing simultaneous high-speed measurements of the real contact area and the strain fields in the region surrounding propagating rupture tips within the dry (nominally flat) rough interfaces formed by brittle polymer blocks. Here we show that the transition from 'static' to 'dynamic' friction is quantitatively described by classical singular solutions for the motion of a rapid shear crack. We find that these singular solutions, originally derived to describe brittle fracture, are in excellent agreement with the experiments for slow propagation, whereas some significant discrepancies arise as the rupture velocity approaches the Rayleigh wave speed. In addition, the energy dissipated in the fracture of the contacts remains nearly constant throughout the entire range in which the rupture velocity is less than the Rayleigh wave speed, whereas the size of the dissipative zone undergoes a Lorentz-like contraction as the rupture velocity approaches the Rayleigh wave speed. This coupling between friction and fracture is critical to our fundamental understanding of frictional motion and related processes, such as earthquake dynamics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Energy landscape theory predicts that the folding funnel for a small fast-folding alpha-helical protein will have a transition state half-way to the native state. Estimates of the position of the transition state along an appropriate reaction coordinate can be obtained from linear free energy relationships observed for folding and unfolding rate constants as a function of denaturant concentration. The experimental results of Huang and Oas for lambda repressor, Fersht and collaborators for C12, and Gray and collaborators for cytochrome c indicate a free energy barrier midway between the folded and unfolded regions. This barrier arises from an entropic bottleneck for the folding process.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: In keeping with the experimental results, lattice simulations based on the folding funnel description show that the transition state is not just a single conformation, but rather an ensemble of a relatively large number of configurations that can be described by specific values of one or a few order parameters (e.g. the fraction of native contacts). Analysis of this transition state or bottleneck region from our lattice simulations and from atomistic models for small alpha-helical proteins by Boczko and Brooks indicates a broad distribution for native contact participation in the transition state ensemble centered around 50\%. Importantly, however, the lattice-simulated transition state ensemble does include some particularly hot contacts, as seen in the experiments, which have been termed by others a folding nucleus.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Linear free energy relations provide a crude spectroscopy of the transition state, allowing us to infer the values of a reaction coordinate based on the fraction of native contacts. This bottleneck may be thought of as a collection of delocalized nuclei where different native contacts will have different degrees of participation. The agreement between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions provides strong support for the landscape analysis.},

	abstract = {The evolution of frictional strength has great fundamental and practical importance. Applications range from earthquake dynamics to hard-drive read/write cycles. Frictional strength is governed by the resistance to shear of the large ensemble of discrete contacts that forms the interface that separates two sliding bodies. An interface's overall strength is determined by both the real contact area and the contacts' shear strength. Whereas the average motion of large, slowly sliding bodies is well-described by empirical friction laws, interface strength is a dynamic entity that is inherently related to both fast processes such as detachment/re-attachment and the slow process of contact area rejuvenation. Here we show how frictional strength evolves from extremely short to long timescales, by continuous measurements of the concurrent local evolution of the real contact area and the corresponding interface motion (slip) from the first microseconds when contact detachment occurs to large (100-second) timescales. We identify four distinct and inter-related phases of evolution. First, all of the local contact area reduction occurs within a few microseconds, on the passage of a crack-like front. This is followed by the onset of rapid slip over a characteristic time, the value of which suggests a fracture-induced reduction of contact strength before any slip occurs. This rapid slip phase culminates with a sharp transition to slip at velocities an order of magnitude slower. At slip arrest, 'ageing' immediately commences as contact area increases on a characteristic timescale determined by the system's local memory of its effective contact time before slip arrest. We show how the singular logarithmic behaviour generally associated with ageing is cut off at short times. These results provide a comprehensive picture of how frictional strength evolves from the short times and rapid slip velocities at the onset of motion to ageing at the long times following slip arrest.},

	abstract = {Molecular recognition is central to all biological processes. For the past 50 years, Koshland's 'induced fit' hypothesis has been the textbook explanation for molecular recognition events. However, recent experimental evidence supports an alternative mechanism. 'Conformational selection' postulates that all protein conformations pre-exist, and the ligand selects the most favored conformation. Following binding the ensemble undergoes a population shift, redistributing the conformational states. Both conformational selection and induced fit appear to play roles. Following binding by a primary conformational selection event, optimization of side chain and backbone interactions is likely to proceed by an induced fit mechanism. Conformational selection has been observed for protein-ligand, protein-protein, protein-DNA, protein-RNA and RNA-ligand interactions. These data support a new molecular recognition paradigm for processes as diverse as signaling, catalysis, gene regulation and protein aggregation in disease, which has the potential to significantly impact our views and strategies in drug design, biomolecular engineering and molecular evolution.},

	abstract = {The TRiC/CCT chaperonin is a 1-MDa hetero-oligomer of 16 subunits that assists the folding of proteins in eukaryotes. Low-resolution structural studies confirmed the TRiC particle to be composed of two stacked octameric rings enclosing a folding cavity. The exact arrangement of the different proteins in the rings underlies the functionality of TRiC and is likely to be conserved across all eukaryotes. Yet despite its importance it has not been determined conclusively, mainly because the different subunits appear nearly identical under low resolution. This work successfully addresses the arrangement problem by the emerging technique of cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and modeling. We cross-linked TRiC under native conditions with a cross-linker that is primarily reactive toward exposed lysine side chains that are spatially close in the context of the particle. Following digestion and mass spectrometry we were able to identify over 60 lysine pairs that underwent cross-linking, thus providing distance restraints between specific residues in the complex. Independently of the cross-link set, we constructed 40,320 (= 8 factorial) computational models of the TRiC particle, which exhaustively enumerate all the possible arrangements of the different subunits. When we assessed the compatibility of each model with the cross-link set, we discovered that one specific model is significantly more compatible than any other model. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis confirmed that this model is 10 times more likely to result from this cross-link set than the next best-fitting model. Our subunit arrangement is very different than any of the previously reported models and changes the context of existing and future findings on TRiC.},

This unbiased analysis finds the native subunit arrangements with overwhelming significance. The resulting structures provide independent crystallographic proof of the subunit arrangement of CCT and map major asymmetrical features of the particle onto specific subunits. The actin and tubulin substrates both bind around subunit CCT6, which shows other structural anomalies.

	abstract = {Predictive methods for the computational design of proteins search for amino acid sequences adopting desired structures that perform specific functions. Typically, design of 'function' is formulated as engineering new and altered binding activities into proteins. Progress in the design of functional protein-protein interactions is directed toward engineering proteins to precisely control biological processes by specifically recognizing desired interaction partners while avoiding competitors. The field is aiming for strategies to harness recent advances in high-resolution computational modelingparticularly those exploiting protein conformational variabilityto engineer new functions and incorporate many functional requirements simultaneously},

Unfortunately, the subject has gained a notorious reputation for difficulty, with forbidding looking mathematics and a peculiar diagrammatic language described in an array of unforgiving, weighty textbooks aimed firmly at aspiring professionals. However, quantum field theory is too important, too beautiful, and too engaging to be restricted to the professionals. This book on quantum field theory is designed to be different. It is written by experimental physicists and aims to provide the interested amateur with a bridge from undergraduate physics to quantum field theory. The imagined reader is a gifted amateur, possessing a curious and adaptable mind, looking to be told an entertaining and intellectually stimulating story, but who will not feel patronised if a few mathematical niceties are spelled out in detail. Using numerous worked examples, diagrams, and careful physically motivated explanations, this book will smooth the path towards understanding the radically different and revolutionary view of the physical world that quantum field theory provides, and which all physicists should have the opportunity to experience.},

The predictions of this model are compared to a full numerical analysis of a rough elastic contact of finite size. The two approaches are found to be in good agreement at low loads, when the asperity spacing is large, but the numerical approach predicts much lower stiffnesses at medium and high loads. It is shown that the overall stiffness cannot exceed that of the equivalent smooth contact, and a simple means of modifying the analytical approach is proposed and validated.},

The experimental observations are interpreted with the help of simulations of a spring-block model for which param- eters are directly derived from the experiment. Stress gra- dients across the contact area are found to play an important role for the frictional behavior.},

	abstract = {A finite element model is used to simulate sliding inception of a rigid flat on a deformable sphere under combined normal and tangential loading. Sliding inception is treated as the loss of tangential contact stiffness under combined effects of plasticity, crack propagation and interfacial slip. Energy dissipation distribution is used to quantify the relative contribution of these mechanisms on the increased compliance during tangential loading. Materials with different strength and toughness properties, and varying local interface conditions ranging from fully adhered to finite friction, are studied to relate variations in plastic deformations, crack and slip to the sliding inception. For fully adhered contact condition, crack and fracture toughness have no effect on sliding inception, with plasticity, the dominant failure mechanism. A measure of recoverable strain (yield strength to Young’s modulus ratio) is found to be the most influential parameter in sliding inception. Interfacial slip is expectedly the dominant mechanism for sliding inception for lower coef- ficient of friction, modeling lubricated contacts. Interplay of plasticity and interfacial slip is found to govern the onset of sliding for higher local friction coefficients. Furthermore, the single asperity results are incorporated in a statistical model for nominally flat contacting rough surfaces under combined normal and tangential loading to investigate the stochastic effects due to surface roughness and material property uncertainties. The results show that the static coefficient of friction strongly depends on the normal load, material properties, local interfacial strength and roughness parameters.},

We compare the glacier events with laboratory experiments that have analogous loading conditions. Both systems exhibit average rupture velocities that increase systematically with the pre-rupture stresses, with local rupture velocities exhibiting large variability that correlates well with local interfacial stresses. The slip events in both cases are not time-predictable, but clearly slip-predictable. Local pre-stress may control rupture behavior in a range of frictional failure events, including earthquakes.},

Frictional motion involves a huge range of time and length scales, coupling the elastic fields of two blocks under stress to the dynamics of the myriad interlocking microscopic contacts that form the interface at their plane of separation. In spite of the immense practical and fundamental importance of friction, many aspects of the basic physics of the problem are still not well understood. One such aspect is the nucleation of frictional motion commonly referred to as the transition from static to dynamic friction. Here we review experimental studies of dynamical aspects of frictional sliding. We focus mainly on recent advances in real-time visualization of the real area of contact along large spatially extended interfaces and the importance of rapid fracture-like processes that appear at the onset of frictional instability.

Temperature is controlled between 20 °C and the glass transitions of poly?methyl metacrylate? and polystyrene. In this article, we focus on static friction force. The static friction threshold to macroscopic slip increases with the contact time. Increasing temperature is found to accelerate markedly the aging process. This effect is correlated with the strong increase of the sensitivity of plastic creep to the strain rate on approaching the glass transition. A constitutive law for creep is established, taking into account the triaxial nature of the deformations at microcontacts between asperities. This is included into a simple model which provides a satisfactory account for the aging process in terms of creep growth of the overall contact area. A strong effect of the shear force sustained by the interface during the aging process is evidenced and discussed. The possible role of healing due to chain diffusion across the interface is considered as a concomitant strengthening process in the glass transition region},

We first analyze in detail the behavior of friction at interfaces between wacroscopic hard rough solids, whose main dynamical features are well described by the Rice-Ruina rate and state dependent constitutive law. We show that it results from two combined effects : (i) the threshold rheology of nanometer-thick junctions jammed under confinement into a soft glassy structure (ii) geometric aging, i.e. slow growth of the real arrea of contact via asperity creep interrupted by sliding. Closer analysis leads to identifying a second aging-rejuvenation process, at work within the junctions themselves. We compare the effects of structural aging at such multicontact, very highly confined, interfaces with those met under different confinement levels, namely boundary lubricated contacts and extended adhesive interfaces involving soft materials (hydrogels, elastomers). This leads us to propose a classification of frictional junctions in terms of the relative importance of jamming and adsoprtion-induced metastability.},

	abstract = {It is usually assumed that the real area of contact between two nominally flat metal surfaces is determined by the plastic deformation of their highest asperities. This leads at once to the result that the real area of contact is directly proportional to the load and independent of the apparent area-a result with many applications in the theories of electric contacts and friction. Archard pointed out that plastic deformation could not be the universal rule, and introduced a model which showed that, contrary to earlier ideas, the area of contact could be proportional to the load even with purely elastic contact. This paper describes a new theory of elastic contact, which is more closely related to real surfaces than earlier theories. We show how the contact deformation depends on the topography of the surface, and establish the criterion for distinguishing surfaces which touch elastically from those which touch plastically. The theory also indicates the existence of an 'elastic contact hardness', a composite quantity depending on the elastic properties and the topography, which plays the same role in elastic contact as the conventional hardness does in plastic contact. A new instrument for measuring surface topography has been built; with it the various parameters shown by the theory to govern surface contact can be measured experimentally. The typical radii of surface asperities have been measured. They were found, surprisingly, to be orders of magnitude larger than the heights of the asperities. More generally we have been able to study the distributions of asperity heights and of other surface features for a variety of surfaces prepared by standard techniques. Using these data we find that contact between surfaces is frequently plastic, as usually assumed, but that surfaces which touch elastically are by no means uncommon in engineering practice.},

Key empirical facts about stellar systems are briefly reviewed, and the ingredients needed to construct galaxy models are assembled, including potential theory, stellar orbits, and the theory of the equilibrium configurations of stellar systems. The stability of these configurations and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their constituent stellar populations. Finally, it is shown that most of the mass in the universe is locked up in some still invisible form.},

Field-theoretic methods are introduced gradually, and the physics is always illustrated with well-chosen examples. Technical details are explained thoroughlly and oftentimes summarized in ``boxes'' which span most of the book. At the end of every chapter, a set of problems allows the reader to test his/her understanding of the subject matter, and solutions to the problems are provided at the end of the book. Two regrets though: (i) that the authors did not touch at all the (less rigorous) but highly intuitive and widely used momentum shell renormalization group technique; and (ii) that the treatment of two-dimensional systems and the Kosterlitz thouless transition is a little superficial. Apart from that, this book is just great. A very useful book.},

Our focus will be mostly on surface tension effects, which result from the cohesive properties of liquids. Paradoxically, cohesive forces promote the breakup of jets, widely encountered in nature, technology and basic science, for example in nuclear fission, DNA sampling, medical diagnostics, sprays, agricultural irrigation and jet engine technology. Liquid jets thus serve as a paradigm for free-surface motion, hydrodynamic instability and singularity formation leading to drop breakup. In addition to their practical usefulness, jets are an ideal probe for liquid properties, such as surface tension, viscosity or non-Newtonian rheology. They also arise from the last but one topology change of liquid masses bursting into sprays.

The second major theme is the central role of the rate-state friction laws in earthquake mechanics, which provide a unifying framework within which a wide range of faulting phenomena can be interpreted. With the inclusion of two chapters explaining brittle fracture and rock friction from first principles, this book is written at a level which will appeal to graduate students and research scientists in the fields of seismology, physics, geology, geodesy and rock mechanics.},

	abstract = {This chapter surveys mathematical methods and principal results in the mechanics of fracture. Primary emphasis is placed on the analysis of crack extension as treated through methods of continuum mechanics. Section II begins with relevant concepts and basic equations from the mechanics of solids, including a survey of elasticity and plasticity, and of associated mathematical methods for boundary value problems, such as analytic function theory. Energy comparison methods and the related path-independent energy integral are introduced in this section; these novel methods of analysis prove to be widely applicable for subse- quently treated notch and crack problems. Section III deals with the application of linear elasticity to fracture. Several two-dimensional crack, problems are solved and approximate methods are presented for determination of stress-intensity factors with more complicated geometries. Theories of elastic-brittle fracture are reviewed and the equivalence of Griffith energy balance and cohesive forces ap- proaches is demonstrated. In addition, dynamic running crack problems, energy rate computations, and stress concentrations at smooth-ended notches are dis- cussed. Section IV, the longest section, deals with the elastic-plastic and fully plastic analysis of fracture. Here, the small-scale yielding approximation, for which elastic stress-intensity factors govern near tip deformation fields, is presented. Elastic-plastic crack problems in plane strain and plane stress are discussed; while these results are necessarily approximate, further insight is provided by treatment of the simpler antiplane strain case. The incremental and path-dependent nature of plastic stress-strain relations is shown to lead to a view of fracture as an instability point in a process of continuing crack advance under increasing load. Additional topics in this section include plastic strain concentrations at smooth ended notches, limit analysis of notched bodies, and a brief treatment of separation mechanisms in ductile materials.},

Moreover, lubricant viscosity affects the onset of friction but has no effect on \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$.

On the contrary, for the self-propelled disks, the mechanical pressure strongly depends on the membrane in use, and is thus not a state variable. When self propelled disks are present on both sides of the membrane, we observe an instability of the membrane akin to the one predicted theoretically for Active Brownian Particles against a soft wall. In that case, the integrated mechanical pressure difference across the membrane can not be computed from the sole knowledge of the packing fractions on both sides; a further evidence of the absence of equation of state.},

	title = {Local equilibrium in bird flocks},
	doi = {10.1038/NPHYS3846},
	abstract = {The correlated motion of flocks is an example of global order emerging from local interactions. An essential diierence with respect to analogous ferromagnetic systems is that flocks are active: animals move relative to each other, dynamically rearranging their interaction network. This non-equilibrium characteristic has been studied theoretically, but its impact on actual animal groups remains to be fully explored experimentally. Here, we introduce a novel dynamical inference technique, based on the principle of maximum entropy, which accommodates network rearrangements and overcomes the problem of slow experimental sampling rates. We use this method to infer the strength and range of alignment forces from data of starling flocks. We find that local bird alignment occurs on a much faster timescale than neighbour rearrangement. Accordingly, equilibrium inference, which assumes a fixed interaction network, gives results consistent with dynamical inference. We conclude that bird orientations are in a state of local quasi-equilibrium over the interaction length scale, providing firm ground for the applicability of statistical physics in certain active systems. A nimal groups moving in concert, such as mammal herds, fish schools, and bird flocks show that in biology, just as in physics, local coordination can result in large-scale order 1–3 . However, flocks differ from classical statistical physics in that their constituents are active: they constantly move by self-propulsion, pumping energy into the system and keeping it out of equilibrium 4–7 . The key element is the rearrangement of the interaction network due to the active motion of individuals relative to each other, continuously changing their neighbours. Theoretical studies show that network rearrangement has major consequences, which include enhancing collective order, reducing the lower critical dimension from 3 to 2, and affecting the critical exponents 4,8 . However, the importance of activity must be assessed with respect to the relevant timescales of the system. The impact of network rearrangement depends on the interplay between its characteristic timescale, τ network , defined as the average time it takes an individual to change its interaction neighbours, and the local relaxation timescale, τ relax , defined as the time needed to relax locally the order parameter if the interaction network were fixed. If τ network ≤ τ relax , the interaction network rearranges at least as fast},

We explic-itly derive the correspondence between this formulation and the dynamics of the individual velocities, thus obtaining a new model of collective motion. In the appropriate overdamped limit we recover the well-known Vicsek model, which dissipates rotational information and does not allow for polarized turns. Although the new model has its most vivid success in describing turning groups, its dynamics is intrinsically different from previous ones in a wide dynamical regime, while reducing to the hydrodynamic description of Toner and Tu at very large length-scales. The derived framework is therefore general and it may describe the collective motion of any strongly polarized active matter system.},

	abstract = {Flocks of birds exhibit a remarkable degree of coordination and collective response. It is not just that thousands of individuals fly, on average, in the same direction and at the same speed, but that even the fluctuations around the mean velocity are correlated over long distances. Quantitative measurements on flocks of starlings, in particular, show that these fluctuations are scale-free, with effective correlation lengths proportional to the linear size of the flock. Here we construct models for the joint distribution of velocities in the flock that reproduce the observed local correlations between individuals and their neighbors, as well as the variance of flight speeds across individuals, but otherwise have as little structure as possible. These minimally structured or maximum entropy models provide quantitative, parameter-free predictions for the spread of correlations throughout the flock, and these are in excellent agreement with the data. These models are mathematically equivalent to statistical physics models for ordering in magnets, and the correct prediction of scale-free correlations arises because the parameters--completely determined by the data--are in the critical regime. In biological terms, criticality allows the flock to achieve maximal correlation across long distances with limited speed fluctuations.},

The bacteria spontaneously form closely packed dynamic clusters within which they move cooperatively. The number of bacteria in a cluster exhibits a power-law distribution truncated by an exponential tail. The probability of finding clusters with large numbers of bacteria grows markedly as the bacterial density increases. The number of bacteria per unit area exhibits fluctuations far larger than those for populations in thermal equilibrium. Such "giant number fluctuations" have been found in models and in experiments on inert systems but not observed previously in a biological system.

It has been observed that for some combinations of frequency and amplitude standing waves are formed at the free surface of the liquid, while for other combinations the free surface remains plane. In this paper the stability of the plane free surface is investigated theoretically when the vessel is a vertical cylinder with a horizontal base, and the liquid is an ideal frictionless fluid making a constant angle of contact of 90° with the walls of the vessel. When the cross-section of the cylinder and the frequency and amplitude of vibration of the vessel are prescribed, the theory predicts that the m th mode will be excited when the corresponding pair of parameters (pm, qm) lies in an unstable region of the stability chart; the surface is stable if none of the modes is excited. (The corresponding frequencies are also shown on the chart.) The theory explains the disagreement between the experiments of Faraday and Rayleigh on the one hand, and of Matthiessen on the other. An experiment was made to check the application of the theory to a real fluid (water). The agreement was satisfactory; the small discrepancy is ascribed to wetting effects for which no theoretical estimate could be given.},

In lecture 2 I discuss applications of this mathematics to the behaviour of microswimmers at surfaces and in external flows, and describe our current understanding of how swimmers stir the surrounding fluid. Lecture 3 concentrates on the collective behaviour of active particles, modelled as an active nematic. I write down the equations of motion and motivate the form of the active stress. The resulting hydrodynamic instability leads to a state termed active turbulence characterised by strong jets and vortices in the flow field and the continual creation and annihilation of pairs of topological defects. Lecture 4 compares simulations of active turbulence to experiments on suspensions of microtubules and molecular motors.

	abstract = {Light-activated self-propelled colloids are synthesized and their active motion is studied using optical microscopy. We propose a versatile route using different photoactive materials, and demonstrate a multiwavelength activation and propulsion. Thanks to the photoelectrochemical properties of two semiconductor materials (α-Fe2O3 and TiO2), a light with an energy higher than the bandgap triggers the reaction of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and produces a chemical cloud around the particle. It induces a phoretic attraction with neighbouring colloids as well as an osmotic self- propulsion of the particle on the substrate. We use these mechanisms to form colloidal cargos as well as self-propelled particles where the light-activated component is embedded into a dielectric sphere. The particles are self-propelled along a direction otherwise randomized by thermal fluctuations, and exhibit a persistent random walk. For sufficient surface density, the particles spontaneously form ‘living crystals’ which are mobile, break apart and reform. Steering the particle with an external magnetic field, we show that the formation of the dense phase results fromthe collisions heads-on of the particles. This effect is intrinsically non-equilibrium and a novel principle of organization for systems without detailed balance. Engineering families of particles self-propelled by different wavelength demonstrate a good understanding of both the physics and the chemistry behind the system and points to a general route for designing new families of self-propelled particles},

While contractile systems enhance the annihilation dynamics of passive systems, extensile systems act to drive defects apart so that they swarm around in the manner of topologically well- characterized self-propelled particles.

	abstract = {Landing is a challenging aspect of flight because, to land safely, speed must be decreased to a value close to zero at touchdown. The mechanisms by which animals achieve this remain unclear. When landing on horizontal surfaces, honey bees control their speed by holding constant the rate of front-to-back image motion (optic flow) generated by the surface as they reduce altitude. As inclination increases, however, this simple pattern of optic flow becomes increasingly complex. How do honey bees control speed when landing on surfaces that have different orientations? To answer this, we analyze the trajectories of honey bees landing on a vertical surface that produces various patterns of motion. We find that landing honey bees control their speed by holding the rate of expansion of the image constant. We then test and confirm this hypothesis rigorously by analyzing landings when the appar- ent rate of expansion generated by the surface is manipulated artificially. This strategy ensures that speed is reduced, gradually and automatically, as the surface is approached. We then develop a mathematical model of this strategy and show that it can effectively be used to guide smooth landings on surfaces of any orientation, including horizontal surfaces. This biological strategy for guiding landings does not require knowledge about either the distance to the surface or the speed at which it is approached. The simplicity and generality of this landing strategy suggests that it is likely to be exploited by other flying animals and makes it ideal for implementation in the guidance systems of flying robots. vision},

The local input of energy and simple particle interactions often lead to complex emergent behavior manifested by the formation of macroscopic vortices and coherent structures with long-range order. A realization of an active system has been conceived by combining swimming bacteria and a lyotropic liquid crystal. Here, by coupling the well-established and validated model of nematic liquid crystals with the bacterial dynamics, we develop a computational model describing intricate properties of such a living nematic. In faithful agreement with the experiment, the model reproduces the onset of periodic undulation of the director and consequent proliferation of topological defects with the increase in bacterial concentration. It yields a testable prediction on the accumulation of bacteria in the cores of +1/2 topological defects and depletion of bacteria in the cores of -1/2 defects. Our dedicated experiment on motile bacteria suspended in a freestanding liquid crystalline film fully confirms this prediction. Our findings suggest novel approaches for trapping and transport of bacteria and synthetic swimmers in anisotropic liquids and extend a scope of tools to control and manipulate microscopic objects in active matter.},

The model we study offers a simple representation of a "cell extract" comprising, e.g., a droplet of actomyosin solution. (Such extracts are used experimentally to model the cytoskeleton). Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the mean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and depolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely from the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when polarity is inverted. Our results suggest that motility can arise in the absence of treadmilling, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity inversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions, we find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls but SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three dimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supracellular level, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of nonmotile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads generically to rotational as well as translational motion.},

	abstract = {Achieving control and tunability of lyotropic materials has been a long-standing goal of liquid crystal research. Here we show that the elasticity of a liquid crystal system consisting of a dense suspension of semiflexible biopolymers can be manipulated over a relatively wide range of elastic moduli. Specifically, thin films of actin filaments are assembled at an oil-water interface. At sufficiently high concentrations, one observes the formation of a nematic phase riddled with \${\textbackslash}pm1/2\$ topological defects, characteristic of a two-dimensional nematic system. As the average filament length increases, the defect morphology transitions from a U-shape into a V-shape, indicating the relative increase of the material's bend over splay modulus. Furthermore, through the sparse addition of rigid microtubule filaments, one can further control the liquid crystal elasticity. We show how the material's bend constant can be raised linearly as a function of microtubule filament density, and present a simple means to extract absolute values of the elastic moduli from purely optical observations. Finally, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict not only the static structure of the material, including its topological defects, but also the evolution of the system into dynamically arrested states. Despite the non-equilibrium nature of the material, our continuum model, which couples structure and hydrodynamics, is able to capture the annihilation and movement of defects over long time scales. Thus, we have experimentally realized a lyotropic liquid crystal system that can be truly engineered, with tunable mechanical properties, and a theoretical framework to capture its structure, mechanics, and dynamics.},

This approach offers a unified framework for the mechanical and statistical properties of living matter: biofilaments and molecular motors in vitro or in vivo, collections of motile microorganisms, animal flocks, and chemical or mechanical imitations. A major goal of this review is to integrate several approaches proposed in the literature, from semimicroscopic to phenomenologi-cal. In particular, first considered are ''dry'' systems, defined as those where momentum is not conserved due to friction with a substrate or an embedding porous medium. The differences and similarities between two types of orientationally ordered states, the nematic and the polar, are clarified. Next, the active hydrodynamics of suspensions or ''wet'' systems is discussed and the relation with and difference from the dry case, as well as various large-scale instabilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter, are highlighted. Further highlighted are various large-scale insta-bilities of these nonequilibrium states of matter. Various semimicroscopic derivations of the continuum theory are discussed and connected, highlighting the unifying and generic nature of the continuum model. Throughout the review, the experimental relevance of these theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of living cells, and vibrated granular material is discussed. Promising extensions toward greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to animal behavior are suggested, and remarks are given on some exotic active-matter analogs. Last, the outlook for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living or artificial constituents, is summarized.},

We then critically examine the assumptions of the classic, scale-free theory of dynamic fracture and note when it works and how it may fail if certain assumptions are relaxed. Several examples are provided in which the introduction of physi-cal scales into this scale-free theory profoundly affects both a crack's structure and the resulting dynamics.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1517545113},
	abstract = {We study rapidly accelerating rupture fronts at the onset of frictional motion by performing high-temporal-resolution measurements of both the real contact area and the strain fields surrounding the propagating rupture tip. We observe large-amplitude and local-ized shear stress peaks that precede rupture fronts and propagate at the shear-wave speed. These localized stress waves, which retain a well-defined form, are initiated during the rapid rupture acceleration phase. They transport considerable energy and are capable of nucleating a secondary supershear rupture. The ampli-tude of these localized waves roughly scales with the dynamic stress drop and does not decrease as long as the rupture front driving it continues to propagate. Only upon rupture arrest does decay initiate, although the stress wave both continues to propa-gate and retains its characteristic form. These experimental results are qualitatively described by a self-similar model: a simplified analytical solution of a suddenly expanding shear crack. Quanti-tative agreement with experiment is provided by realistic finite-element simulations that demonstrate that the radiated stress waves are strongly focused in the direction of the rupture front propagation and describe both their amplitude growth and spatial scaling. Our results demonstrate the extensive applicability of brittle fracture theory to fundamental understanding of friction. Implica-tions for earthquake dynamics are discussed. nonsteady rupture dynamics {\textbar} acoustic radiation {\textbar} friction {\textbar} earthquake dynamics {\textbar} seismic radiation T he onset of motion along a frictional interface entails rup-ture-front propagation. These rupture fronts have long been considered to have much in common with propagating cracks (1– 3). Recent friction experiments (4) have shown that the stresses and material motion surrounding the tip of a propagating rup-ture are indeed quantitatively described by singular linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) solutions originally developed for brittle shear fracture. These singular fields are only regularized by dissipative and nonlinear processes in the vicinity of the rupture tip. Nonsteady processes such as rapid rupture velocity variation during the nucleation or arrest phases result in the generation of stress-wave radiation (2, 5). In the study of earthquakes, un-derstanding the source mechanism of those waves is of primary importance. Long-wavelength radiation is usually described by simple dislocation models (3, 6). High-frequency radiation, how-ever, was proposed (2) to be controlled by the strong slip velocity concentrations at the rupture tip predicted by fracture mechanics. Descriptions that go beyond singular contributions to fracture involve significant analytical complications; full solutions of non-steady dynamic crack problems are generally extremely difficult to obtain. Of the few full-field analytic solutions available, self-similar solutions of suddenly expanding shear cracks have provided much intuition (2, 5, 7, 8). These solutions, under shear loading (mode II), predict a localized shear stress peak that propagates ahead of the rupture tip at the shear-wave velocity. The results obtained in such solutions are generally considered as an upper bound for the realistic stress-wave radiation of smoothly accelerating ruptures. Radiated shear stress peaks have, for decades, drawn special at-tention, because they are thought to be an important vehicle for the nucleation of supershear ruptures, a class of ruptures that propagate beyond the shear-wave speed, C S . These ruptures sur-pass the Rayleigh wave speed, C R , the classic " speed limit " for rapid singular cracks. This idea was first postulated in ref. 1 and later numerically observed in ref. 9, who found that a sufficiently strong shear stress peak can overcome interfacial strength and nucleate a daughter crack that will propagate at supershear ve-locities (10–15). Such supershear ruptures have indeed been observed along natural fault planes (16, 17) and in laboratory experiments (18–21). Despite their importance, experimental studies of radiated stress waves have been very limited. Here we present direct measurements of the stress fields surrounding the tips of rapidly propagating ruptures and show how a shear stress peak is formed. Supplementing experiments with finite-element calculations, we provide a detailed description of both the scaling and space–time structure of this phenomenon.},

	title = {Fracture mechanics determine the lengths of interface ruptures that mediate frictional motion},
	doi = {10.1038/NPHYS3539},
	abstract = {The transition from static to sliding friction is mediated by rapid interfacial ruptures 1–5 propagating through the solid contacts forming a frictional interface 6 . While propagating, these ruptures correspond to true shear cracks 7 . Frictional sliding is initiated only when a rupture traverses the entire interface 1 ; however, arrested ruptures can occur at applied shears far below the transition to frictional motion 8–17 . Here we show, by measuring the real contact area and strain fields near rough frictional interfaces, that fracture mechanics quantitatively describe rupture arrest and therefore determine the onset of overall frictional sliding. Our measurements reveal both the local dissipation and the global elastic energy released by the rupture. The balance of these quantities entirely deter-mines rupture lengths, whether finite or system-wide. These results confirm a fracture-mechanics-based paradigm 7,15,18 for describing frictional motion and shed light on the selection 18–21 of an earthquake's magnitude. A frictional interface is formed by the interlocked solid asperities of rough surfaces in contact, whose area is much smaller than the nominal one 6 . Failure of the asperities via rupture fronts is the fundamental mechanism responsible for the transition from static to sliding frictional motion 1,4 . Ruptures can propagate well before the onset of global sliding, and then arrest before spanning the entire interface. Rupture arrest can, for example, result from inhomogeneous stress distributions along the interface 8–10 . As no overall motion of the contacting bodies is induced by such events, they are often called precursors to sliding motion. Arrested events are analogous to earthquakes, which are dynamic ruptures of finite extent within pre-existing natural faults; the boundary between contacting tectonic plates 22,23 . Predicting the length of precursory ruptures is, therefore, closely related to the question of what determines the size of an earthquake 18–21 . Since their initial discovery 8 , a rich variety of models has been dedicated to the dynamics of precursory ruptures in frictional systems. Aimed at reproducing nucleation and arrest, these include minimalistic one-dimensional (1D) models 9 , discrete contacts descriptions 11,13,16 , rate-and-state friction laws 17 and fracture mechanics 12 . These models are able to reproduce the existence of arrested ruptures but they provide no explicit predictions of where and how arrest occurs in real systems. Recent theoretical work 15 explained the available data 8 by explicitly demonstrating how fracture mechanics can be used to predict rupture arrest. Here we describe new experiments that confirm these theoretical predictions and show that this general framework indeed enables us to understand the selection of rupture length for any system geometries and loading conditions. Recent experiments have shown that the strain fields driving ruptures along frictional interfaces are described 7 by the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM; ref. 24). In this context, a precursory event is an arrested crack 12,15,18 . In fracture mechanics, crack arrest is defined by the Griffith criterion 24 , a crack arrests when the amount of energy flowing to its tip becomes smaller than the fracture energy Γ , the dissipated energy per unit crack advance. Following the theoretical approach outlined in earlier studies 15,18 we will experimentally verify that this criterion is fulfilled by spontaneously arrested frictional ruptures. These results provide new insights into the predictability of both frictional processes and earthquake dynamics. We examine the frictional sliding of two poly(methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) blocks whose contact interface is flat to within a few µm. We define x, y and z as, respectively, the rupture propagation, normal loading and sample thickness directions. We use two different sample geometries (Fig. 1a). The asymmetric geometry is formed by blocks of different thicknesses (6 mm top block, 30 mm bottom block) and dimensions with a 3 µm r.m.s. surface roughness along the interface. The symmetric geometry is made of blocks having the same dimensions whose interface is formed by two optically flat surfaces. PMMA has a strain-rate-dependent Young's modulus 3 {\textless} E {\textless} 5.6 GPa and Poisson ratio v = 1/3. The Rayleigh wave speeds are c R = 1,237 ± 10 m s},

Under fixed compression, both systems exhibit monotonic nonexponential relaxation. However, when after a certain waiting time the compression is partially reduced, both systems exhibit a nonmonotonic response: the normal force first increases over many minutes or even hours until reaching a peak value, and only then is relaxation resumed. The peak time scales linearly with the waiting time, indicating that these systems retain long-lasting memory of previous conditions. Our results and the measured scaling relations are in good agreement with a theoretical model recently used to describe observations of monotonic aging in several glassy systems, suggesting that the nonmonotonic behavior may be generic and that athermal systems can show genuine glassy behavior.},

	abstract = {Zh. Tekh. Fiz. 69, 132–133 ͑November 1999͒ A theory for an approximate description of the breakup of a thin liquid jet issuing from an orifice into drops is devised on the basis of mass and energy balance equations. Attention is focused mainly on the effects of the surface tension forces. The mathematical analysis performed permits unequivocal estimation of the relative value of the mean diameter of the drops formed and the distances between them, which agree closely with the known results of experimental observations and the value of the Rayleigh wavelength from the linear theory of jet instability. A thin liquid jet issuing through a circular orifice under pressure breaks up into drops in the surrounding atmosphere even at low velocities. This phenomenon has found broad application in technology. Neglecting the effects of viscosity, compressibility, and gravity ͑where possible͒, Rayleigh 1 at-tributed this phenomenon to the instability of the cylindrical liquid body formed, which develops mainly from surface tension forces. Their action leads to progressive growth of any random local decrease in the jet diameter relative to its mean value of 2a, which is accompanied by a corresponding expulsion of liquid and the formation of nearby bulges on the jet. As a result, there is regular alternation of contracted and expanded segments of the initially equilibrium, circular cy-lindrical configuration of the liquid column. The pinched segments, which gradually elongate, rupture with the forma-tion of tiny droplets, while the bulging segments transform into large ͑main͒ drops, which are separated by equal dis-tances and are subjected to deformation pulsations. It was shown in Ref. 1 on the basis of a linear analysis of small axisymmetric disturbances of a jet ͑disturbances of the form ϳF(r) • exp(ikzϩ␻t), where ␭ϭ2␲/k) that their maximum growth rate corresponds to the wavelength ␭ * ϭ4.51 • (2a).

	abstract = {We propose a nonequilibrium continuum dynamical model for the collective motion of large groups of biological organisms (e.g., flocks of birds, slime molds, etc.) Our model becomes highly nontrivial, and different from the equilibrium model, for d {\textasciitilde} d, . = 4; nonetheless, we are able to determine its scaling exponents exactly in d = 2 and show that, unlike equilibrium systems, our model exhibits a broken continuous symmetry even in d = 2. Our model describes a large universality class of microscopic rules, including those recently simulated by Vicsek et al. PACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 64.60.Cn, 64.60.Ht The dynamics of flocking" behavior among living things, such as birds, slime molds, and bacteria, has long been a mystery. Recently, a number of simple numerical models that exhibit such behavior have been studied [1,2]. For example, Ref. [2] considers a synchronous, discrete time step rule in which an individual "bird" in a group of "birds" determines its next direction of motion on each time step by averaging the direction of its neighbors in a certain area, and then adding some zero mean noise, while keeping the magnitude of its velocity constant. Their simulations in two dimensions find a transition between an ordered phase in which the mean velocity of the flock (v) 4 0 and a disordered phase with (v) = 0 as the strength of the noise is increased. The above two-dimensional model is very similar to the 2D XY model [3,4] because the velocity of the "bird, " like the local spin of the classical XY model, also has fixed length and continuous rotational symmetry. Indeed, it is easy to see that, in the limit that the magnitude of the velocity goes to zero, on each time step the "birds' are just picking a new direction, but never actually move, the model reduces precisely to the Monte Carlo dynamics of a two-dimensional XY model, with the (small) bird velocity playing the role of the XY spin. Since the 2D XY model does not exhibit a long-range ordered phase at temperatures T) 0 (due to spin wave fluctuations), the long-range ordered state observed in Ref. [2] seems very surprising. Indeed, in light of the Mermin-Wagner theorem [5] for equilibrium systems, its existence must depend on fundamentally dynamical, nonequilibrium aspects of the model. In this paper, we show, using a continuum dynamical equation which describes a large universality class of related dynamical models, that this is indeed the case. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate the following: (1) that our model differs from the equilibrium system for spatial dimensions d {\textasciitilde} 4, (2) we can calculate the scaling exponents of this model exactly for d = 2, and (3) the model does, indeed, have a stable spontaneous symmetry broken state even in two dimensions. Our starting point is the continuum equations of motion (EOM) [6]: i), v + (v . iv')v = nv — Pivot v — VP + Dt V'(iv' v) +Did'v+D2(v V) v+ f, Bp + V. (vp) =0, (2) Bt where P, Dt, D2, and DL are all positive, and n (0 in the disordered phase and n) 0 in the ordered state. The left hand side of Eq. (1) is just the usual convective derivative of the coarse-grained velocity field v. The n and P terms simply make the local v have a nonzero magnitude (= Qn/P) in the ordered phase. DL i z are diffusion constants. The Gaussian random noise f has correlations: (f, (,t)f, (', t')) = » " {\textasciitilde}'(. — ')\&(» — t'), where 5 is a constant and i and j denote Cartesian components. Finally, the pressure P = P(p) = P c. (p — po)", n=l where po is the mean of the local number density and p(r) and o. " are coefficients in the pressure expansion. The final equation (2) rejects conservation of birds. The essential difference between our model and the equilibrium XY model is the existence of the convective term in our model, which makes the dynamics nonpoten-tial and further stabilizes the ordered phase. A heuristic argument for the stabilizing effect of the convective term can be given if we consider our model in Lagrangian co-ordinates. In those coordinates, the convective term drops out and the interaction between the velocity field is local at each instance. However, at different times, the "neigh-bors ' of one particular bird will be different depending on the velocity field itself. Therefore, two originally distant birds can interact with each other at some later time. It is exactly this time dependent variable ranged interaction which stabilizes the ordered phase. 4326 0031-9007/95/75(23)/4326(4) \$06.00 1995 The American Physical Society},

	title = {Flocks, herds, and schools: {A} quantitative theory of flocking},
	volume = {58},
	abstract = {We present a quantitative continuum theory of ''flocking'': the collective coherent motion of large numbers of self-propelled organisms. In agreement with everyday experience, our model predicts the existence of an ''ordered phase'' of flocks, in which all members of even an arbitrarily large flock move together with the same mean velocity ͗v ជ ͘0. This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken sym-metry: no preferred direction for the motion is picked out a priori in the model; rather, each flock is allowed to, and does, spontaneously pick out some completely arbitrary direction to move in. By analyzing our model we can make detailed, quantitative predictions for the long-distance, long-time behavior of this ''broken symmetry state.'' The ''Goldstone modes'' associated with this ''spontaneously broken rotational symmetry'' are fluctuations in the direction of motion of a large part of the flock away from the mean direction of motion of the flock as a whole. These ''Goldstone modes'' mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock, far larger, at long wavelengths, than those in, e.g., an equilibrium gas. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time-dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an nϭd component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions dϾ4, the long-distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory, and is equivalent to that of an unusual but nonetheless equilibrium model for spin systems. For dϽ4, nonlinear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in dϭ2, where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in dϭ2 ͑the ''Mermin-Wagner'' theorem͒. We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real flocks. We also consider an anisotropic model, in which the birds move preferentially in an ''easy'' ͑e.g., horizontal͒ plane, and make analogous, but quantitatively different, predictions for that model as well. For this anisotropic model, we obtain exact scaling exponents for all spatial dimensions, including the physically relevant case dϭ3. ͓S1063-651X͑98͒08410-4͔ PACS number͑s͒: 87.10.ϩe, 64.60.Cn, 05.60.ϩw},

But this type of complex motion is rarely seen in computer animation. This paper explores an approach based on simulation as an alternative to scripting the paths of each bird individually. The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natu-ral flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates ac-cording to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggre-gate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

	title = {Novel {Type} of {Phase} {Transition} in a {System} of {Self}-{Driven} {Particles}},
	abstract = {A simple model with a novel type of dynamics is introduced in order to investigate the emergence of self-ordered motion in systems of particles with biologically motivated interaction. In our model particles are driven with a constant absolute velocity and at each time step assume the average direction of motion of the particles in their neighborhood with some random perturbation (g) added. We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, {\textasciitilde}v, (= 0) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry. The transition is continuous, since {\textasciitilde}v, {\textasciitilde} is found to scale as (71, — g)t with p = 0.45. PACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 64.60. — i One of the most interesting aspects of many particle systems is that they exhibit a complex cooperative behav-ior during phase transition [1]. This remarkable feature of equilibrium systems has been studied in great detail for the last couple of decades leading to a deeper understand-ing of processes which may take place in an assembly of interacting particles. Concepts like scaling, universality, and renormalization have resulted in a systematic picture of a wide range of systems in physics [1,2]. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the rich behavior of systems which are far from equilibrium. Processes such as aggregation, viscous fIows, or biologi-cal pattern formation have been shown to involve scaling of the related geometrical and dynamic quantities char-acterizing these phenomena [3,4]. As a further similarity with equilibrium systems, the existence of phase transition type behavior has also been demonstrated in several inves-tigations of growth processes [5 — 8]. These analogies with the basic features of equilibrium systems have represented a particularly important contribution to the understanding of the complex behavior of nonequilibrium processes. In this work we introduce a model with a novel type of dynamics in order to investigate clustering, transport, and phase transition in nonequilibrium systems where the velocity of the particles is determined by a simple rule and random fluctuations. The only rule of the model is at each time step a given particle driven with a constant absolute velocity assumes the average direction of motion of the particles in its neighborhood of radius r with some random perturbation added. We show using simulations that, in spite of its simplicity, this model results in a rich, realistic dynamics, including a kinetic phase transition from no transport to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry. In this sense our model is a transport related, nonequi-librium analog of the ferromagnetic type of models, with the important difference that it is inherently dynamic: The elementary event is the motion of a particle between two time steps. Thus the analogy can be formulated as fol-lows: The rule corresponding to the ferromagnetic inter-action tending to align the spins in the same direction, in the case of equilibrium models, is replaced by the rule of aligning the direction of motion of particles in our model of cooperative motion. The level of random perturbations we apply are in analogy with the temperature. Beyond the above aspects, the proposed model is interesting because of possible applications in a wide range of biological systems involving clus-tering and migration. Biological subjects have the tendency to move as other subjects do in their neigh-borhood [9]. In addition to such trivial examples as schools of fish, herds of quadrupeds, or Rocks of Hying birds, our model can be applied to the less known phe-nomena during bacterial colony growth [10]. There are bacteria (e.g., a strain of Bacillus Subtilis) which exhibit cooperative motion in order to survive under unfavorable conditions. The present model, with some modifications, is already capable of reproducing the main observed features of the motion (collective rotation and llocking) of bacteria [10]. Other biologically motivated, recent theoretical investigations of clustering, aggregation, and orientational order in systems with diffusing directed objects have concentrated on the possible spatial patterns arising from an integro-differential equation approach and from cellular automata type models [11]. Furthermore, we expect that our model can be used to interpret the results of experiments on clustering and convection in a system of disks floating on air table [12]. These experiments represent a physically motivated possible application of the present model, since they are being carried out in order to understand the How of granular materials under specific conditions. We are aware that two groups are working on developing models similar to ours in order to interpret these air table experiments [13]. 1226 0031-9007/95/75(6) /1226(4) \$06.00},

Explicit expressions for the transport coefficients are given, as a function of the microscopic parameters of the model. We show that the homogeneous state with zero hydrodynamic velocity is unstable above a critical density (which depends on the microscopic parameters), signalling the onset of a collective motion. Comparison with numerical simulations on a standard model of self-propelled particles shows that the phase diagram we obtain is robust, in the sense that it depends only slightly on the precise definition of the model. While the homogeneous flow is found to be stable far from the transition line, it becomes unstable with respect to finite-wavelength perturbations close to the transition, implying a non-trivial spatio-temporal structure for the resulting flow.

	abstract = {Soft materials consist of basic units that are significantly larger than an atom but much smaller than the overall dimensions of the sample. The label " soft condensed matter " emphasizes that the large basic building blocks of these materials produce low elastic moduli that govern a material's ability to withstand deformations. Aside from softness, there are many other properties that are also caused by the large size of the constituent building blocks. Soft matter is dissipative, disordered, far from equilibrium, nonlinear, thermal and entropic, slow, observable, gravity affected, patterned, nonlocal, interfacially elastic, memory forming, and active. This is only a partial list of how matter created from large component particles is distinct from " hard matter " composed of constituents at an atomic scale. Issues inherent in soft matter raise problems that are broadly important in diverse areas of science and require multiple modes of attack. For example, far-from-equilibrium behavior is confronted in biology, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics. Similarly, issues dealing with disorder appear broadly throughout many branches of inquiry wherever rugged landscapes are invoked. This article reviews the discussions that occurred during a workshop held on 30–31 January 2016 in which opportunities in soft-matter experiment were surveyed. Soft matter has had an exciting history of discovery and continues to be a fertile ground for future research.},

A multitude of carefully orchestrated transport processes are needed to move water and minerals from the soil to sites of photosynthesis and to distribute energy-rich sugars throughout the plant body to support metabolism and growth. The long-distance transport happens in the plants' vascular system, where water and solutes are moved along the entire length of the plant. In this review, the current understanding of the mechanism and the quantitative description of these flows are discussed, connecting theory and experiments as far as possible. The article begins with an overview of low-Reynolds-number transport processes, followed by an introduction to the anatomy and physiology of vascular transport in the phloem and xylem. Next, sugar transport in the phloem is explored with attention given to experimental results as well as the fluid mechanics of osmotically driven flows. Then water transport in the xylem is discussed with a focus on embolism dynamics, conduit optimization, and couplings between water and sugar transport. Finally, remarks are given on some of the open questions of this research field.},

In a large domain of parameter space including the transition region, well-defined high-density and high-order propagating solitary structures are shown to dominate the dynamics. Far enough from the transition region, on the other hand, these objects are not present.

A critical slip velocity is observed that signifies a transition in the frictional behavior: enhanced velocity weakening of A and τ. These measurements enable us to infer the contact shear strength, an otherwise elusive quantity, and show that the contact shear strength persistently increases with slip rate.

	abstract = {We describe an active polymer network in which processive molecular motors control network elasticity. This system consists of actin fila-ments cross-linked by filamin A (FLNa) and contracted by bipolar filaments of muscle myosin II. The myosin motors stiffen the network by more than two orders of magnitude by pulling on actin filaments anchored in the network by FLNa cross-links, thereby generating internal stress. The stiffening response closely mimics the effects of external stress applied by mechanical shear. Both internal and exter-nal stresses can drive the network into a highly nonlinear, stiffened regime. The active stress reaches values that are equivalent to an external stress of 14 Pa, consistent with a 1-pN force per myosin head. This active network mimics many mechanical properties of cells and suggests that adherent cells exert mechanical control by operating in a nonlinear regime where cell stiffness is sensitive to changes in motor activity. This design principle may be applicable to engineering novel biologically inspired, active materials that adjust their own stiffness by internal catalytic control.},

We studied the spatiotemporal patterns that emerge when an active nematic film of microtubules and molecular motors is encapsulated within a shape-changing lipid vesicle. Unlike in equilibrium systems, where defects are largely static structures, in active nematics defects move spontaneously and can be described as self-propelled particles. The combination of activity, topological constraints, and vesicle deformability produces a myriad of dynamical states. We highlight two dynamical modes: a tunable periodic state that oscillates between two defect configurations, and shape-changing vesicles with streaming filopodia-like protrusions.

	title = {Orientational order of motile defects in active nematics},
	doi = {10.1038/NMAT4387},
	abstract = {The study of liquid crystals at equilibrium has led to funda-mental insights into the nature of ordered materials, as well as to practical applications such as display technologies. Active nematics are a fundamentally diierent class of liquid crystals, driven away from equilibrium by the autonomous motion of their constituent rod-like particles 1–4 . This internally generated activity powers the continuous creation and annihilation of topological defects, which leads to complex streaming flows whose chaotic dynamics seem to destroy long-range order 5–11 . Here, we study these dynamics in experimental and computa-tional realizations of active nematics. By tracking thousands of defects over centimetre-scale distances in microtubule-based active nematics, we identify a non-equilibrium phase characterized by a system-spanning orientational order of defects. This emergent order persists over hours despite defect lifetimes of only seconds. Similar dynamical structures are observed in coarse-grained simulations, suggesting that defect-ordered phases are a generic feature of active nematics. Topological defects play important roles in diverse phenomena ranging from high-energy physics and cosmology to traditional condensed-matter systems 12 . For instance, the spontaneous unbind-ing of dislocation pairs mediates the melting of 2D crystals 13 . Despite their usual role as centres of disorder, defects can also organize into higher-order equilibrium structures with emergent properties, such as liquid-crystalline twist-grain-boundary phases and flux-line lattices in superconductors 14,15 . Far less is understood about the role of defects in active-matter systems, which are driven away from equilibrium by the motion of their constituent particles 16–24 . Previous work on active nematics has demonstrated an instability at large wavelengths 5 which leads to spontaneous defect nucleation and unbinding 6–10 . In contrast to the well-studied passive defects found in equilibrium matter, defects in active nematics are motile 25 , and are continuously generated and annihilated, producing a dy-namical defect-riddled phase that is inherently out of equilibrium. The observed dynamics are complex and chaotic, and seem to destroy the long-range ordering of the underlying nematic. Here, by tracking thousands of defects over long times, we demonstrate that defects self-organize into a higher-order phase with broken rotational symmetry. The orientational ordering of defects spans macroscopic samples and persists for the sample lifetime of many hours, despite the lifetimes of the constituent defects being orders of magnitude shorter. Our experimental system is comprised of micrometre-long stabi-lized microtubules (MTs), streptavidin clusters of biotin-labelled ki-nesin motors 26 and the non-adsorbing polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG) (Fig. 1a). In a bulk suspension, PEG induces the formation of MT bundles by the depletion mechanism 27,28 . The same interaction also depletes MTs onto a surfactant-stabilized oil/water interface. Centrifugation makes it possible to spin down all the MT bundles onto the interface, leading to the formation of a dense quasi-2D MT film that exhibits local orientational order. Each kinesin cluster binds to multiple MTs. As each motor within the cluster hydrolyses adenosine triphosphate (ATP), it moves towards the plus end of a MT and induces interfilament sliding 29 . This generates extensile me-chanical stresses that drive the nematic film away from equilibrium (Fig. 1b). A biochemical regeneration system maintains a constant ATP concentration and powers the system for over 24 h (see Supple-mentary Methods). We image these active nematics with both fluo-rescence microscopy and LC-PolScope 30 . LC-PolScope measures the orientation of the nematic director field θ(r) with pixel resolution. It also measures the magnitude of the birefringence, which reveals the effective thickness of the nematic film, or retardance field (r) (see Supplementary Fig. 4 for an extended discussion). Using a ×4 objective, we observe the dynamics of the MT film over the entire field of view, corresponding to an area of 2.3 × 1.7 mm. In parallel, we have developed a tractable coarse-grained computational model. Our approach employs Brownian dynamics simulations of rigid spherocylinders which, in equilibrium, form a nematic phase 31 . Long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions are omitted, producing an essentially dry system. The length of each constituent rod increases at a constant rate, producing an extensile stress similar to the motor-driven extension of MT bundles (Fig. 1d). On reaching a preset maximum length, a spherocylinder is split in half and two other rods are simultaneously merged, thus keeping the total particle number fixed (see Supplementary Methods). Although inspired by the dynamics of MT bundles, this approach is not meant to quantitatively reproduce specific features of the experimental system, but simply to capture its microscopic symmetries (nematic interparticle alignment and extensile nematic activity). In equilibrium, nematic defects anneal to minimize the free energy, eventually producing a uniformly aligned state. It is not possible to prepare an analogous state in extensile active nematics, as uniform alignment is inherently unstable to bend deformations 5 . These distortions grow in amplitude and produce a fracture line, terminated at one end by a defect of charge +1/2, and by a −1/2 defect at the other (Fig. 1c). The asymmetry of +1/2 defects causes motor-generated stresses to produce a net propulsive force, leading to extension of the fracture line. Above a critical length, the fracture line self-heals, leaving behind a pair of isolated, oppositely charged defects 9 . For experimental ATP concentration, +1/2 defects move at speeds of ∼8 µm s −1 . Defects are transient objects; on average, a +1/2 defect exists for 40 s before colliding with a −1/2 defect and annihilating, leaving behind a uniformly aligned nematic region 32},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Conventional nonequili-brium systems are composed of inanimate components whose dynamics is powered by the external input of energy. For example, in a turbulent fluid, energy cascades down many length scales before being dissipated. In com-parison, diverse nonequilibrium processes in living organisms are powered at the micro-scopic scale by energy-transducing molecular processes. Energy injected at the smallest scales cascades up many levels of structural organiza-tion, collectively driving dynamics of subcellular organelles, cells, tissues, and entire organisms. However, the fundamental principles by which animate components self-organize into active materials and machines capable of producing macroscopic work remain unknown. Elucidating these rules would not only provide insight into organization processes that take place in living matter but might lay the foundation for the engineering of self-organized machines com-posed of energy-consuming animate components that are capable of mimicking the properties of the living matter. METHODS: We studied isotropic active fluids composed of filamentous microtubules, clusters of kinesin molecular motors, and depleting polymers. The polymer bundles microtubules, whereas the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)– fueled motion of kinesin clusters powers their extension. The extensile bundles consist of op-positely aligned polar microtubules and thus have quadrupolar (nematic) symmetry. They generate local active stresses that collectively drive mesoscale turbulent-like dynamics of bulk active fluids. Upon ATP depletion, the motion of microscopic motors grinds to a halt; the turbulent-like dynamics of active fluids ceases, and one recovers the behavior of con-ventional gels. We confined such active isotropic fluids into three-dimensional (3D) toroids, disks, and other complex geometries whose dimensions' range from micrometers to meters and studied their self-organized dynamics. Using particle tracking and image analysis, we simultaneously quantified the flow of the background fluid and the structure of the active microtubule network that drives such fluid flows. RESULTS: We demonstrate that 3D confine-ments and boundaries robustly transform turbulent-like dynamics of bulk active fluids into self-organized coherent macroscopic flows that persist on length scales ranging from micrometers to meters and time scales of hours.

	title = {Information transfer and behavioural inertia in starling flocks},
	doi = {10.1038/NPHYS3035},
	abstract = {Collective decision-making in biological systems requires all individuals in the group to go through a behavioural change of state. During this transition fast and robust transfer of information is essential to prevent cohesion loss. The mechanism by which natural groups achieve such robustness, however, is not clear. Here we present an experimental study of starling flocks performing collective turns. We find that information about direction changes propagates across the flock with a linear dispersion law and negligible attenuation, hence minimizing group decoherence. These results contrast starkly with present models of collective motion, which predict diiusive transport of information. Building on spontaneous symmetry breaking and conservation-law arguments, we formulate a theory that correctly reproduces linear and undamped propagation. Essential to this framework is the inclusion of the birds' behavioural inertia. The theory not only explains the data, but also predicts that information transfer must be faster the stronger the group's orientational order, a prediction accurately verified by the data. Our results suggest that swift decision-making may be the adaptive drive for the strong behavioural polarization observed in many living groups. C onsider a flock of starlings under direct threat from a peregrine falcon. To dodge the attack, the group constantly changes direction of motion. Each such change, however, puts the flock in a vulnerable condition, which the predator is ready to exploit. The slightest uncertainty in turning may decrease cohesion, or even split the flock and push some birds astray, leaving them easy prey of the falcon. Keeping cohesion during collective decision-making is a general issue in social species, for which living in a group is a matter of fitness 1–3 . Irrespective of the consensus mechanism leading to the decision, its actual execution cannot be instantaneous, as a certain amount of time is needed to propagate the decision throughout the group. During this time, cohesion is strained by the mismatch between individuals who have already changed behavioural state and those who have not yet done so. The mechanism by which the information is transferred from individual to individual has therefore a significant impact on collective decision-making 4–8 . In the footsteps of the seminal work by Pomeroy and Heppner 9 , we study here natural flocks of starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) performing collective turns in the field (Supplementary Movie 1). By using a 3-camera set-up 10 (see Methods), we reconstruct the full three-dimensional (3D) trajectory of each bird in the flock (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Movie 2). For each pair of birds, i and j, we calculate their mutual turning delay, τ ij , defined as the amount of time by which bird j turns before (τ ij {\textgreater} 0) or after (τ ij {\textless} 0) bird i (Fig. 1d,e). By using the delays τ ij we rank all birds in the flock according to their turning order; that is, we find the first to turn, the second and so on. Each bird i is thus labelled by its rank, r i , and by its absolute turning time, t i , that is, the delay of i with respect to the top bird in the rank (Methods). We can then plot the rank r i of each bird as a function of its absolute turning time t i , thus obtaining the ranking curve, r(t) in Fig. 2a (Supplementary Fig. 3). We find that the top birds in the rank, namely the first birds to turn, are physically close to each other (Fig. 2b). Hence, the decision to turn has a spatially localized origin and it then propagates across the group through a bird-to-bird ('social') transfer of information 11 . The alternative view, namely that the turn is caused by an external stimulus hitting all birds at the same time, would imply an independent response of each bird and thus a spatially unstructured distribution of the delay times, whereas we always find a clear spatial modulation of the delays (Supplementary Movie 2). Our aim is to determine the mechanism through which information propagates from its local origin to the rest of the flock. From the ranking curve we can calculate the dispersion law, namely how much distance x the information travels in a time t. We are in three dimensions and the turn has a localized origin; hence, x(t) is equal to the radius of the sphere containing the first r(t) birds in the rank, namely x(t) = [r(t)/ρ] 1/3 , where ρ is the density of the flock. The most important feature of the curve x(t) (Fig. 2c) is that there is a clear linear regime for early and intermediate times (before border effects kick in—see Supplementary Appendix A). We conclude that the distance travelled by the information grows linearly with time, x(t) = c s t. The parameter c s is the speed of propagation of the directional information; its value is in the range 20–40 m s −1 . These values of c s are high: the decision to turn can sweep through a flock of 400 birds in little more than half a second. We stress that x(t) is the distance travelled by the information in the flock's reference frame: this transport is not the mere effect},

	abstract = {We explore a generic mechanism whereby a droplet of active mat-ter acquires motility by the spontaneous breakdown of a discrete symmetry. The model we study offers a simple representation of a " cell extract " comprising, e.g., a droplet of actomyosin solution. (Such extracts are used experimentally to model the cytoskeleton). Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the mean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and depolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely from the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when polarity is inverted. Our results sug-gest that motility can arise in the absence of treadmilling, by spon-taneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity inversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions, we find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls but SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three dimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supracellular level, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of nonmotile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads generically to rotational as well as translational motion.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1005766107},
	abstract = {From bird flocks to fish schools, animal groups often seem to react to environmental perturbations as if of one mind. Most studies in collective animal behavior have aimed to understand how a glob-ally ordered state may emerge from simple behavioral rules. Less effort has been devoted to understanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a whole reacts to its envi-ronment. Yet, in the presence of strong predatory pressure on the group, collective response may yield a significant adaptive advan-tage. Here we suggest that collective response in animal groups may be achieved through scale-free behavioral correlations. By reconstructing the 3D position and velocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what extent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each other. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a constant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result indicates that behavioral correlations are scale free: The change in the behavioral state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other animals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations provide each animal with an effective perception range much larger than the direct interindivid-ual interaction range, thus enhancing global response to perturba-tions. Our results suggest that flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to environmental perturbations. animal groups {\textbar} collective behavior {\textbar} flocking {\textbar} self-organization {\textbar}},

	abstract = {Flocks of birds exhibit a remarkable degree of coordination and collective response. It is not just that thousands of individuals fly, on average, in the same direction and at the same speed, but that even the fluctuations around the mean velocity are correlated over long distances. Quantitative measurements on flocks of starlings, in particular, show that these fluctuations are scale-free, with effective correlation lengths proportional to the linear size of the flock. Here we construct models for the joint distribution of velocities in the flock that reproduce the observed local correlations between individuals and their neighbors, as well as the variance of flight speeds across individuals, but otherwise have as little structure as possible. These minimally structured or maximum entropy models provide quantitative, parameter-free predictions for the spread of correlations throughout the flock, and these are in excellent agree-ment with the data. These models are mathematically equivalent to statistical physics models for ordering in magnets, and the correct prediction of scale-free correlations arises because the parameters— completely determined by the data—are in the critical regime. In biological terms, criticality allows the flock to achieve maximal correlation across long distances with limited speed fluctuations. collective behavior {\textbar} statistical mechanics},

The mean squared displacement of passive tracers exhibits a short-time regime with nearly ballistic transport and a diffusive long-time regime.

	title = {Collective motion and density fluctuations in bacterial colonies},
	abstract = {Flocking birds, fish schools, and insect swarms are familiar exam-ples of collective motion that plays a role in a range of problems, such as spreading of diseases. Models have provided a qualitative understanding of the collective motion, but progress has been hin-dered by the lack of detailed experimental data. Here we report simultaneous measurements of the positions, velocities, and orien-tations as a function of time for up to a thousand wild-type Bacillus subtilis bacteria in a colony. The bacteria spontaneously form closely packed dynamic clusters within which they move coopera-tively. The number of bacteria in a cluster exhibits a power-law distribution truncated by an exponential tail. The probability of finding clusters with large numbers of bacteria grows markedly as the bacterial density increases. The number of bacteria per unit area exhibits fluctuations far larger than those for populations in thermal equilibrium. Such " giant number fluctuations " have been found in models and in experiments on inert systems but not ob-served previously in a biological system. Our results demonstrate that bacteria are an excellent system to study the general phenom-enon of collective motion. swarming ∣ self-organization ∣ active suspensions D espite differences in the length scales and the cognitive abil-ities of constituent individuals, collective motion in systems as diverse as bird flocks, mammal herds, swarming bacteria, and vibrating granular particles (1–8) produces similar patterns of ex-tended spatiotemporal coherence, suggesting general principles of collective motion. One approach to unveil these principles has been to model individuals as interacting self-propelled particles, which align their motions with neighbors (8–13). Some models also include repulsive and attractive interactions between particles in addition to the local alignment of velocities. With empirically chosen parameters such as the range over which the local alignment occurs, self-propelled particle models pro-duce motions qualitatively similar to the observations. For exam-ple, within certain parameter regimes, models (8, 13) predict that collectively moving individuals form dynamic clusters, as often seen in fish schools or mammal herds (1); these clusters lead to large fluctuations in population density. Quantitatively, analy-tic theories based on liquid crystal physics (14–16) have predicted that these density fluctuations should scale with system size differently from fluctuations in thermal equilibrium systems. In contrast to numerical models and analytical theories, quan-titative experiments have been limited (2–8), though decisive experiments are urgently needed to test the theoretical assump-tions, determine sensitive modeling parameters, and verify theo-retical predictions. The lack of experimental data is mainly due to technical difficulties. In conventional macroscopic systems, such as bird flocks, it is exceedingly challenging to track individual mo-tions of a large population over long periods of time, and studies with systematic parameter variation are rarely possible. Recent studies (17–22) have shown that concentrated swim-ming bacteria, which can be considered as self-propelled polar microrods, under well-controlled conditions exhibit collective motion. These studies suggest that bacterial systems can serve as a promising alternative to the macroscopic systems to investi-gate general phenomena of collective motion. However, in pre-vious studies, bacteria were so closely packed that it has not been possible to identify and simultaneously track many individual bac-teria in collective motion for a long period of time. In this article, we investigate collective bacterial motion in wild-type Bacillus subtilis colonies growing on agar substrates. Inside colonies, bacteria swim in a micrometer-thick film of liquid on the agar surface (23, 24); the bacteria are not observed to swim over one another. By tracking many individual bacteria, we quantify the correlations among bacteria, statistical properties of dynamic clusters, and the scaling of density fluctuations.},

	abstract = {With remarkable precision and reproducibility, cells orchestrate the cooperative action of thousands of nanometre-sized molecular motors to carry out mechanical tasks at much larger length scales, such as cell motility, division and replication 1 . Besides their bio-logical importance, such inherently non-equilibrium processes suggest approaches for developing biomimetic active materials from microscopic components that consume energy to generate continuous motion 2–4 . Being actively driven, these materials are not constrained by the laws of equilibrium statistical mechanics and can thus exhibit sought-after properties such as autonomous motility, internally generated flows and self-organized beating 5–7 . Here, starting from extensile microtubule bundles, we hierarchically assemble far-from-equilibrium analogues of conventional polymer gels, liquid crystals and emulsions. At high enough concentration, the microtubules form a percolating active network characterized by internally driven chaotic flows, hydrodynamic instabilities, enhanced transport and fluid mixing. When confined to emulsion droplets, three-dimensional networks spontaneously adsorb onto the droplet surfaces to produce highly active two-dimensional nematic liquid crystals whose streaming flows are controlled by internally generated fractures and self-healing, as well as unbinding and annihilation of oppositely charged disclination defects. The resulting active emulsions exhibit unexpected properties, such as autonomous motility, which are not observed in their passive ana-logues. Taken together, these observations exemplify how assem-blages of animate microscopic objects exhibit collective biomimetic properties that are very different from those found in materials assembled from inanimate building blocks, challenging us to develop a theoretical framework that would allow for a systematic engineering of their far-from-equilibrium material properties. We assembled active materials from microtubule filaments, which are stabilized with the non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogue GMPCPP, leading to an average length of 1.5 mm. Bundles were formed by adding a non-adsorbing polymer—poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG—which induces attractive interactions through the well-studied depletion mechanism. To drive the system far from equilibrium, we added bio-tin-labelled fragments of kinesin-1, a molecular motor that converts chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical movement along a microtubule 8 . Kinesins were assembled into multi-motor clus-ters by tetrameric streptavidin, which can simultaneously bind and move along multiple microtubules, inducing inter-filament sliding (Fig. 1a). In this respect, our experiments build upon important earlier work that demonstrated the formation of asters and vortices in net-works of unbundled microtubules and kinesin},

To do so, we compute perturbatively their steady-state measure and show that, for short persistent times, the entropy production rate vanishes. This endows such systems with an effective fluctuation-dissipation theorem akin to that of thermal equilibrium systems.

Here we show that the spherical motile bacteria Serratia marcescens exhibit robust collective dynamics and correlated coherent motion while grown in suspensions. As cells migrate to the upper surface of a drop, they form a monolayer, and move collectively in whirls and jets. At all concentrations, the distribution of the bacterial speed was approximately Rayleigh with an average that depends on concentration in a non-monotonic way. Other dynamical parameters such as vorticity and correlation functions are also analyzed and compared to rod-shaped bacteria from the same strain. Our results demonstrate that self-propelled spherical objects do form complex ordered collective motion. This opens a door for a new perspective on the role of cell aspect ratio and alignment of cells with regards to collective motion in nature.},

	title = {Meso-scale turbulence in living fluids},
	abstract = {Turbulence is ubiquitous, from oceanic currents to small-scale biological and quantum systems. Self-sustained turbulent motion in microbial suspensions presents an intriguing example of collec-tive dynamical behavior among the simplest forms of life and is important for fluid mixing and molecular transport on the micro-scale. The mathematical characterization of turbulence phenomena in active nonequilibrium fluids proves even more difficult than for conventional liquids or gases. It is not known which features of turbulent phases in living matter are universal or system-specific or which generalizations of the Navier–Stokes equations are able to describe them adequately. Here, we combine experiments, par-ticle simulations, and continuum theory to identify the statistical properties of self-sustained meso-scale turbulence in active sys-tems. To study how dimensionality and boundary conditions affect collective bacterial dynamics, we measured energy spectra and structure functions in dense Bacillus subtilis suspensions in qua-si-2D and 3D geometries. Our experimental results for the bacterial flow statistics agree well with predictions from a minimal model for self-propelled rods, suggesting that at high concentrations the collective motion of the bacteria is dominated by short-range inter-actions. To provide a basis for future theoretical studies, we pro-pose a minimal continuum model for incompressible bacterial flow. A detailed numerical analysis of the 2D case shows that this theory can reproduce many of the experimentally observed features of self-sustained active turbulence. low Reynolds number swimming ∣ velocity increment distributions ∣ scaling S imple forms of life, like amoebae or bacteria, self-organize into remarkable macroscopic patterns (1, 2), ranging from ex-tended networks (3, 4) to complex vortices (5–10) and swarms (11). These structures often bear a striking resemblance to assem-blies of higher organisms [e.g., flocks of birds (12) or schools of fish (13, 14)] and present important biological model systems to study nonequilibrium phases and their transitions (15–17). A par-ticularly interesting manifestation of collective behavior in micro-bial suspensions is the emergence of meso-scale turbulent motion (7, 8, 18, 19). Driven by the microorganisms' self-propulsion and their mutual interactions, such self-sustained " active turbulence " can have profound effects on nutrient mixing and molecular transport in microbiological systems (2, 20–22). However, in spite of recent progress (19, 23–25), the phenomenology of turbulent bacterial dynamics is scarcely understood and a commonly ac-cepted theoretical description is lacking (2, 16, 26). The latter fact may not be surprising given that a comprehensive mathematical characterization of turbulence in conventional fluids has re-mained elusive after more than a century of intense research (27). In view of the various physical and chemical pathways through which bacteria may communicate (1, 11, 28), a basic yet unsolved problem is to identify those interactions that are responsible for the emergence of collective behavior in dense suspensions (2, 29, 30). Answering this question is essential for understanding whether physical mechanisms such as flagellar bundling or hydro-dynamic long-range interactions are relevant to collective bacter-ial motion; it is also crucial for constraining the vast number of theoretical models that have been proposed during the past two decades (2, 16, 19, 31, 32) but have yet to be tested against experiments. An equally important, unresolved issue pertains to the " universality " of turbulent phenomena in active systems and their relation to turbulence in passive fluids (27). In ordinary liquids and gases, such as water or air, turbulent vortices form due to external forcing if the Reynolds number (Re), the ratio of inertial to viscous forces, is very large (Re ≫ 1). By contrast, bacteria provide an internal microscopic forcing and operate at Re ∼ 10 −5 (33). It is therefore unclear how, or to what extent, the characteristics of self-sustained turbulent states in microbial sus-pensions differ from those of classical turbulence in passive fluids. Here, we combine numerical simulations, high-speed micro-scopic imaging and continuum theory to identify generic statisti-cal properties of active turbulent motion in dense bacterial systems, using Bacillus subtilis as a model organism. Unlike pre-vious investigations of collective bacterial swimming in 2D free-standing films (8) and 3D bulk suspensions with liquid–gas interfaces (7, 24, 25), we conducted experiments in closed quasi-2D and 3D microfluidic chambers to minimize external influ-ences and to compare the effects of boundary conditions and dimensionality. Our analysis focuses on traditional turbulence measures, such as energy spectra and velocity structure functions (27, 34, 35). These quantities have been widely studied for turbu-lent high-Re Navier-Stokes flow (27, 36–41), but their character-istics are largely unknown for active fluids. We compare our experimental results with large-scale simulations of a 2D minimal model for self-propelled rods. In the past, similar models (42) have proven useful for identifying generic aspects of flocking and swarming in active systems (43, 44). We find that, although the SPR model neglects details of bacterial cell–cell interactions, it is able to reproduce many features of our experimental data, sug-gesting that collective bacterial dynamics in dense suspensions is dominated by short-range interactions (30). We complement our experiments and particle-based simulation studies by identifying a minimal continuum model for incompressible active flow that combines elements from the Toner–Tu (15–17) and Swift–Hohen-berg (45) theories.},

	title = {Topological defects in confined populations of spindle-shaped cells},
	doi = {10.1038/NPHYS3876},
	abstract = {Most spindle-shaped cells (including smooth muscles and sarcomas) organize in vivo into well-aligned 'nematic' do-mains 1–3 , creating intrinsic topological defects that may be used to probe the behaviour of these active nematic systems. Active non-cellular nematics have been shown to be dominated by activity, yielding complex chaotic flows 4,5 . However, the regime in which live spindle-shaped cells operate, and the importance of cell–substrate friction in particular, remains largely unexplored. Using in vitro experiments, we show that these active cellular nematics operate in a regime in which activity is eeectively damped by friction, and that the interaction between defects is controlled by the system's elastic nematic energy. Due to the activity of the cells, these defects behave as self-propelled particles and pairwise annihilate until all displacements freeze as cell crowding increases 6,7 . When confined in mesoscopic circular domains, the system evolves towards two identical +1/2 disclinations facing each other. The most likely reduced positions of these defects are independent of the size of the disk, the cells' activity or even the cell type, but are well described by equilibrium liquid crystal theory. These cell-based systems thus operate in a regime more stable than other active nematics, which may be necessary for their biological function. Ever since Otto Lehman 8 and Georges Friedel 9 showed that the microscopic structure of nematic or smectic phases could be inferred from a careful observation of their characteristic structural defects, the study of liquid crystals has gone hand in hand with a characterization of the topological defects—that is, singular points in the orientation field—that affect the long-range orientational order 10 . Far-from-equilibrium active nematics are no exception to that rule. These systems are composed of interacting elongated self-propelled particles that actively align with their neighbours, in a nematic or polar phase 11 . These collective behaviours are observed in a wide variety of systems and length scales, and share common universal properties 11 . For example, actin microfilaments or mi-crotubules associated with their molecular motors 4,5,12,13 , elongated motile cells 1,3,14 or bacteria 15 , or more macroscopic systems, such as fish swimming in schools 16 , exhibit strong long-range alignment. Spindle-shaped cells spontaneously form nematic arrangements in vivo in diverse situations, such as smooth muscles or pathological tissues such as sarcomas. It has been shown 1–3 that, when plated on a surface at sufficiently high density, these cells self-align in a bidimensional nematic phase. As time proceeds, the cell density increases via cell proliferation, which increases the nematic ordering but also gradually freezes the cell movements 6,17–20 , resulting in a juxtaposition of large, perfectly ordered domains whose directors are not aligned. These domains are separated by topological defects trapped in the structure 3 . On the theoretical side, several recent works have addressed the behaviours of defects in active nematics by adding active terms to the hydrodynamic equations of liquid crystals. Although there are differences between these approaches 21 , they all converge in showing that active systems differ from passive nematics by the spontaneous motion of the +1/2 topological defects, which behave as self-propelled particles 22,23 , the creation/annihilation of pairs of defects of opposite signs 22–24 , or the associated velocity correlations in the bulk 25,26 . Most of the active systems that have been identified so far operate in a regime where activity is large and viscous damping dominates cell–substrate friction 4 . However, live cells are known to develop adhesion with their substrate, yielding a large friction 21 . Here, by studying the topological defects in a nematic cell monolayer, we propose to assess the contribution of friction in these systems. We first present experimental results dealing with proliferating spindle-shaped NIH 3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts that interact via steric hindrance when plated on fibronectin-coated glass substrates (Supplementary Methods). Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE1) cells and C2C12 mouse myoblasts behaved very similarly. To study the structural defects in this system, we dynamically mapped the orientation field and the velocity field after confluence, defined as the point where the surface is entirely covered by cells (Fig. 1a–c). The root-mean-square (r.m.s.) velocity, taken as an indirect measurement of the cells' activity 25 (Supplementary Fig.},

We also find that the number of interacting neighbors is independent of flock den-sity, confirming that interactions are ruled by topological rather than metric distance.

Nontrivial behavior results when the model is formally continued below two dimensions. Although the physical interpretation of the Navier-Stokes equations below d = 2 is unclear, the results apply to a forced Burger's equation in one dimension. A large class of models produces a spectral function E ( k ) which behaves as k 2 in three dimensions, as expected on the basis of equipartition.

	abstract = {Narayan et al. (Reports, 6 July 2007, p. 105) reported giant number fluctuations attributed to curvature-driven active currents specific for nonequilibrium nematic systems. We present data demonstrating that similar results can be found in systems of spherical particles due either to inelastic clustering or persistent density inhomogeneity, suggesting two alternative explanations for their results. N arayan et al. (1) presented experimental evidence that a fluidized monolayer of macroscopic granular rods in the active nematic phase exhibits giant number fluctua-tions consistent with a standard deviation grow-ing linearly with the mean, in contrast to the behavior expected for any situation in which the central limit theorem applies. These giant number fluctuations were attributed to curvature-driven active currents specific for nonequilibrium nemat-ic systems. Granular systems often exhibit statistical properties sharply distinct from their equilibrium counterparts, for example, non-Gaussian veloc-ity distributions in dissipative gases (2, 3). Giant number fluctuations were predicted on the basis of perturbation analysis of a nearly spatially uni-form state of a generic phenomenological model for active nematics (4). Although we do not ques-tion the possibility that giant fluctuations associ-ated with nematic ordering may be present in the system analyzed by Narayan et al., on the basis of two complementary experiments with spherical particles we demonstrate that the linear growth of the standard deviation DN with the mean N can arise either from dynamic inelastic clustering or from persistent density inhomogeneity. We performed experiments with monolayers of spherical grains energized either by mechani-cal vertical vibration (5) or by an alternating vertical electric field (6). Although the driving mechanisms are very different, the observed be-havior is similar: a transition from the uniform gas state for high amplitude driving (vibration or electric field amplitude) to inhomogeneous phase-separated states at lower amplitudes of the driving. We analyzed DN versus N using two different coarse-graining procedures. The first procedure (P1, temporal averaging first) is identical to that used by Narayan et al. (1). We partitioned the experimental system into M small subsystems of equal size L and measured the number of particles N i in each subsystem. The fluctuation in a given subsystem was calculated from the series of N i versus time by measuring the mean square deviation from the average N for that subsystem. The values of DN for all of the subsystems in the frame were then averaged and plotted against the average N for the experiment. The results of our analyses (Fig. 1) are notably similar to that shown in Fig. 1B in Narayan et al. Namely, for the homogeneous gas-like states, we observed normal fluctuations DN/N 1/2 {\textasciitilde} 1 (Fig. 1, circles). When N approaches N 0 , the value of DN/N 1/2 goes to 0, approximately as DN/N 1/2 = (1 – N/N 0)},

It runs wildly across scales in both space and time, involving taxonomically vastly different organisms, from bacteria and cell clusters, to insect swarms and up to vertebrate groups. It entails concepts as diverse as coordination, emergence, interaction, information, cooperation, decision-making, and synchronization. Amid this jumble, however, we cannot help noting many similarities between collective behavior in biological systems and collective behavior in statistical physics, even though none of these organisms remotely looks like an Ising spin. Such similarities, though somewhat qualitative, are startling, and regard mostly the emergence of global dynamical patterns qualitatively different from individual behavior, and the development of system-level order from local interactions. It is therefore tempting to describe collective behavior in biology within the conceptual framework of statistical physics, in the hope to extend to this new fascinating field at least part of the great predictive power of theoretical physics. In this review we propose that the conceptual cornerstone of this ambitious program be that of correlation. To illustrate this idea we address the case of collective behavior in bird flocks. Two key threads emerge, as two sides of one single story: the presence of scale-free correlations and the dynamical mechanism of information transfer. We discuss first static correlations in starling flocks, in particular the experimental finding of their scale-free nature, the formulation of models that account for this fact using maximum entropy, and the relation of scale-free correlations to information transfer. This is followed by a dynamic treatment of information propagation (propagation of turns across a flock), starting with a discussion of experimental results and following with possible theoretical explanations of those, which require the addition of behavioral inertia to existing theories of flocking. We finish with the definition and analysis of space– time correlations and their relevance to the detection of inertial behavior in the absence of external perturbations.},

Notably, these two earthquakes had a maximum slip that was very close to the surface 3,4 . This contributed to the destructive tsunami that occurred during the Tohoku-Oki event and to the large amount of structural damage caused by the Chi-Chi event. The mechanism that results in such large slip near the surface is poorly understood as shallow parts of thrust faults are considered to be frictionally stable 5 . Here we use earthquake rupture experiments to reveal the existence of a torquing mechanism of thrust fault ruptures near the free surface that causes them to unclamp and slip large distances. Complementary numerical modelling of the experiments confirms that the hanging-wall wedge undergoes pronounced rotation in one direction as the earthquake rupture approaches the free surface, and this torque is released as soon as the rupture breaks the free surface, resulting in the unclamping and violent 'flapping' of the hanging-wall wedge. Our results imply that the shallow extent of the seismogenic zone of a subducting interface is not fixed and can extend up to the trench during great earthquakes through a torquing mechanism. As the recent 2011 moment magnitude (M w) 9.0 Tohoku-Oki event clearly demonstrated, the shallow portion (up to several tens of kilometres down-dip from the trench axis) of a subduction zone can not only slip seismically but can also slip to a large distance of about 50 m (ref. 3). A similar observation was made during the 1999 M w 7.7 Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, during which the shallow part of the fault slipped as much as 15 m (ref. 4).

Here we report on novel measurements of evolving local friction during spontaneously developing mini-earthquakes in the laboratory, enabled by our ultrahigh speed full-field imaging technique. The technique captures the evolution of displacements, velocities and stresses of dynamic ruptures, whose rupture speed range from sub-Rayleigh to supershear. The observed friction has complex evolution, featuring initial velocity strengthening followed by substantial velocity weakening. Our measurements are consistent with rate-and-state friction formulations supplemented with flash heating but not with widely used slip-weakening friction laws. This study develops a new approach for measuring local evolution of dynamic friction and has important implications for understanding earthquake hazard since laws governing frictional resistance of faults are vital ingredients in physically-based predictive models of the earthquake source.},

	abstract = {modified parameters (7) to account for the present experimental conditions. Our choice of parameters reflects the reduced amount of TGA per CdTe, resulting in a net decrease of the charge, an increase of the face-face attraction energy, and a change in the direction of the dipole moment as compared with the conditions under which chains are obtained. We used a recently developed technique for predicting ordered assemblies of building blocks with strong interactions via bottom-up building block assembly (BUBBA) (26) to determine the preferred local packing structure of tetrahedrons within ribbons. Then, Monte Carlo simulations were used to calculate the energy as a function of ribbon width to ascertain whether, and under what conditions, ribbons of finite width (rather than chains or sheets) (1, 8) were the minimum energy structures. We found that NPs form four interdigitated layers grouped in two bilayers with tetrahedrons arranged hexagonally and inverted in alternate layers for denser packing (Fig. 4), which is consistent with TEM and SEM observa-tions (Figs. 1, G to I, and 2B), albeit without the packing perfection seen in the simulations. The energy of the ribbon is minimized for a range of widths of {\textasciitilde}18 to 110 nm, which matches struc-tural parameters of TRs very well (Figs. 1 to 3). Increasing the charge resulted in more narrow ribbons, whereas decreasing the charge resulted in wider ribbons. Overall, the multiparticle behavior and tran-sition from packing into chains, ribbons, and sheets can be understood in terms of a competition be-tween the face-face attraction and the charge-charge repulsion. For low charge and strong face attraction, as was the case in previous studies (1), particles pack very densely and would, if constrained to the same packing structure, form infinite two-dimensional sheets. By increasing the amount of charge, an infinite sheet becomes energetically unfavorable because of the long-range electrostatic repulsion, and NPs assemble as ribbons. Further increase of particle charge will eventually result in chains, as was observed for higher concentrations of TGA (6, 8). Note that this concerns the effect of NP charge before the assembly. Once a larger NP system is assembled and held together by strong interparticle interactions, it may not be able to transition freely from sheets to ribbons of smaller width and then to chains. However, if there are structural units more loosely attached to each other, such as ribbons in bunches, they do separate, as can be seen by the unraveling of the bouquets of TRs (Fig. 3D and fig. S14). The notion of evolving NP assemblies and better understanding of parameters controlling behavior of large numbers of nanoscale particles as a whole will be useful for many other nano-colloid systems. This study demonstrates that light can induce microscale twisting of the matter due to strong effect on the mutual interactions of nano-scale building blocks in a multibody system. The modulation in the pitch length for the TRs under different light intensities creates a new approach in the synthesis of nanostructures and new oppor-tunities to generate nanomaterials with controlled circular dichroism and other optical, electronic, and mechanical properties.},

The static friction threshold to macroscopic slip increases with the contact time. Increasing temperature is found to accelerate markedly the aging process. This effect is correlated with the strong increase of the sensitivity of plastic creep to the strain rate on approaching the glass transition. A constitutive law for creep is established, taking into account the triaxial nature of the deformations at microcontacts between asperities. This is included into a simple model which provides a satisfactory account for the aging process in terms of creep growth of the overall contact area. A strong effect of the shear force sustained by the interface during the aging process is evidenced and discussed. The possible role of healing due to chain diffusion across the interface is considered as a concomitant strengthening process in the glass transition region. ͓S0163-1829͑99͒00322-7͔},

	abstract = {We were able to successfully capture rupture nucleation processes on a 2-D fault surface during large-scale biaxial friction experiments using metagabbro rock specimens. Several rupture nucleation patterns have been detected by a strain gauge array embedded inside the rock specimens as well as by that installed along the edge walls of the fault. In most cases, the unstable rupture started just after the rupture front touched both ends of the rock specimen (i.e., when rupture front extended to the entire width of the fault). In some cases, rupture initiated at multiple locations and the rupture fronts coalesced to generate unstable ruptures, which could only be detected from the observation inside the rock specimen. Therefore, we need to carefully examine the 2-D nucleation process of the rupture especially when analyzing the data measured only outside the rock specimen. At least the measurements should be done at both sides of the fault to identify the asymmetric rupture propagation on the fault surface, although this is not perfect yet. In the present experiment, we observed three typical types of the 2-D rupture propagation patterns, two of which were initiated at a single location either close to the fault edge or inside the fault. This initiation could be accelerated by the free surface effect at the fault edge. The third one was initiated at multiple locations and had a rupture coalescence at the middle of the fault. These geometrically complicated rupture initiation patterns are important for understanding the earthquake nucleation process in nature.},

	abstract = {A B S T R A C T We conduct meter-scale rock friction experiments to study strain rate effect on fault slip and rupture evolution. Two rock samples made of Indian metagabbro, with a nominal contact dimension of 1.5 m long and 0.1 m wide, are juxtaposed and loaded in a direct shear configuration to simulate the fault motion. A series of experimental tests, under constant loading rates ranging from 0.01 mm/s to 1 mm/s and under a fixed normal stress of 6.7 MPa, are performed to simulate conditions with changing strain rates. Load cells and displacement trans-ducers are utilized to examine the macroscopic fault behavior, while high-density arrays of strain gauges close to the fault are used to investigate the local fault behavior. The observations show that the macroscopic peak strength, strength drop, and the rate of strength drop can increase with increasing loading rate. At the local scale, the observations reveal that slow loading rates favor generation of characteristic ruptures that always nucleate in the form of slow slip at about the same location. In contrast, fast loading rates can promote very abrupt rupture nucleation and along-strike scatter of hypocenter locations. At a given propagation distance, rupture speed tends to increase with increasing loading rate. We propose that a strain-rate-dependent fault fragmentation process can enhance the efficiency of fault healing during the stick period, which together with healing time controls the recovery of fault strength. In addition, a strain-rate-dependent weakening mechanism can be activated during the slip period, which together with strain energy selects the modes of fault slip and rupture propagation. The results help to understand the spectrum of fault slip and rock deformation modes in nature, and emphasize the role of heterogeneity in tuning fault behavior under different strain rates.},

We appeal to dynamic rupture theory to extract and highlight previously unnoticed aspects and results, which are of direct relevance to our new experiments. Kinematic relationships derived from both singular and non-singular solutions are applied to analyze and interpret various features observed in these experiments. A strong correspondence is demonstrated between particle velocity records obtained in lab experiments and synthetic particle velocity waveform profiles derived from theory. Predicted temporal profiles, sense of particle motion, and amplitude decay properties of sub-Rayleigh and supershear particle velocity waveforms are experimentally verified. In a particular set of supershear rupture experiments, the fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) velocity waveforms were simultaneously recorded at fixed, off-fault field points as a shear Mach front swept these locations. Particle velocity records collected over a broad range of stable supershear rupture speeds validate the predicted scaling relationship δu̇1s/δu̇2s=Vr2/Cs2−1=βs, between the FP (δu1ṡ) and the FN (δu2ṡ) velocity jumps propagated by a shear Mach front. Additional experimental findings include detailed rupture speed measurements of sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures and the observation of a supershear daughter crack with vanishing shear Mach front. Previously unappreciated scaling relations between particle velocity field components, attributed to dilatational and shear waves, are also developed and experimentally verified. In particular, the FP velocity jump δu1ṡ(x1,x2) propagated by the shear Mach front, and the sliding speed δu̇1(x1,0+), measured at a field point positioned extremely close to the frictional fault plane, are shown to obey a speed-dependent scaling relationship given by δu̇1s/δu̇1+=1−2Cs2Vr2, which was gleaned from a non-singular, steady state velocity field solution.},

	title = {Slow slip and the transition from fast to slow fronts in the rupture of frictional interfaces},
	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1321752111},
	abstract = {The failure of the population of microjunctions forming the fric-tional interface between two solids is central to fields ranging from biomechanics to seismology. This failure is mediated by the propagation along the interface of various types of rupture fronts, covering a wide range of velocities. Among them are the so-called slow fronts, which are recently discovered fronts much slower than the materials' sound speeds. Despite intense modeling activ-ity, the mechanisms underlying slow fronts remain elusive. Here, we introduce a multiscale model capable of reproducing both the transition from fast to slow fronts in a single rupture event and the short-time slip dynamics observed in recent experiments. We identify slow slip immediately following the arrest of a fast front as a phenomenon sufficient for the front to propagate further at a much slower pace. Whether slow fronts are actually observed is controlled both by the interfacial stresses and by the width of the local distribution of forces among microjunctions. Our results show that slow fronts are qualitatively different from faster fronts. Because the transition from fast to slow fronts is potentially as generic as slow slip, we anticipate that it might occur in the wide range of systems in which slow slip has been reported, including seismic faults. friction {\textbar} multiscale modeling {\textbar} onset of sliding {\textbar} stick–slip T he rupture of frictional interfaces is a central mechanism in many processes, including snow slab avalanches, human ob-ject grasping, and earthquake dynamics (1). Rupture occurs through the propagation of a crack-like microslip front—the rupture front— across the interface. This front represents the moving boundary between a stick region and a slipping region that coexist within the interface plane. In so-called partial-slip situations, fronts propagate quasistatically at a pace controlled by the external loading, as studied in mechanical engineering for decades (2, 3). Recently, fast cameras enabled the observation of much faster fronts, which are classified into three types: supershear fronts faster than the material's shear wave speed c s , sub-Rayleigh fronts propagat-ing at velocities close to c s , and slow fronts much slower than c s (4–8). Whereas the first two types have been predicted theo-retically, the physical mechanisms underlying slow fronts are still debated. A better understanding of slow fronts appears as a significant step toward an improved assessment of how frictional motion begins. It is also expected to shed light on the important topic of slow earthquakes, which have been increasingly reported in the last decade (1). In this context, an intense theoretical and nu-merical activity arose to investigate the origins and properties of rupture fronts. Two different approaches have been explored. On the one hand, 2D or 3D elastodynamic models have been used to relate the macroscopic loading conditions to the stress field along the contact interface (9–13). These local stresses were indeed shown experimentally to play a role in the selection of the front type (6). However, the models were based on simple fric-tion laws, e.g., Coulomb friction (11) or velocity-weakening friction (12, 13) and did not exhibit slow fronts. On the other hand, fronts much slower than the speed of sound were produced by 1D friction models using improved local friction laws in-volving an intrinsic time-scale: either (i) an aging scale related to the long-time strengthening of an interface at rest (14, 15) as is classically considered in rate-and-state theories (16, 17), or (ii) a dynamic scale related to the short-time collective dynamics of formation and rupture of a statistical number of microjunctions during the rupture of the interface (18, 19). Time scales i and ii were shown, in the same experiment (20), to control the recovery of contact area after slip arrest and the transition between a fast and a slow regime for the slip motion triggered by the front passage, respectively. However, because 1D models are unable to reproduce realistic stress distributions at the interface, they do not allow for quantitative comparison with experiments. Here we combine both 2D elastodynamics and time-dependent friction into a multiscale model for rupture fronts. We demonstrate that the model simultaneously reproduces two separate, unexplained experimental observations: the transition between fast and slow front propagation during a single rupture event, and the transi-tion from fast to slow slip motion at the interface shortly after rupture. In addition, through a more general study of the model, we show that slow slip occurring immediately after a fast front's arrest is a sufficient phenomenon for the front to propagate further as a slow front, and we identify parameters involved in front type selection.},

	abstract = {We summarize studies of earthquake fault models that give rise to slip complexities like those in natural earthquakes. For models of smooth faults between elastically deformable continua, it is critical that the friction laws involve a characteristic distance for slip weakening or evolution of surface state. That results in a finite nucleation size, or coherent slip patch size, h*. Models of smooth faults, using numerical cell size properly small compared to h*, show periodic response or complex and apparently chaotic histories of large events but have not been found to show small event complexity like the self-similar (power law) Gutenberg-Richter frequency-size statistics. This conclusion is sup-ported in the present paper by fully inertial elastodynamic modeling of earthquake sequences. In contrast, some models of locally heterogeneous faults with quasi-independent fault segments, represented approximately by simulations with cell size larger than h* so that the model becomes "inherently discrete," do show small event complexity of the Gutenberg-Richter type. Models based on classical friction laws without a weakening length scale or for which the numerical procedure imposes an abrupt strength drop at the onset of slip have h* = 0 and hence always fall into the inherently discrete class. We suggest that the small-event complexity that some such models show will not survive regularization of the constitutive de-scription, by inclusion of an appropriate length scale leading to a finite h*, and a corresponding reduction of numerical grid},

	volume = {124},
	abstract = {--An understanding of the frictional sliding on faults that can lead to earthquakes requires a knowledge of both constitutive behavior of the sliding surfaces and its mechanical interaction with the loading system. We have determined the constitutive parameters for frictional sliding of initially bare surfaces of Westerly granite, using a recently developed high pressure rotary shear apparatus that allows long distances of sliding and therefore a greater assurance of attaining steady state behavior. From ex-periments conducted at room temperature and normal stresses of 27-84 MPa several important results have been found. (1) A gouge layer 100 to 200 \#m thick was developed from the initially bare rock surfaces after 18 to 70 mm of sliding. (2) The steady state frictional resistance, attained after about 10 mm of sliding, is proportional to the negative of the logarithm of the sliding velocity. (3) Abrupt changes in the velocity of sliding result in initial changes in the frictional resistance, which have the same sign as the velocity change, and are followed by a gradual decay to a new steady state value over a characteristic distance of sliding. This velocity weakening behavior is essentially identical with that found by several previous workers on the same material at lower normal stress. (4) Our results are well described by a two state variable constitutive law. The values of the constitutive parameters are quite similar to those found previously at low normal stress, but the characteristic distance is about an order of magnitude smaller than that found at 10 MPa normal stress with thicker layers of coarser gouge. (5) We have approximated our results with a one state variable constitutive law and compared the results with the predictions of existing nonlinear stability analysis; in addition, we have extended the stability analysis to systems possessing two state variables. With such formulations good agreement is found between the experimentally observed and theoretically predicted transitions between stable and unstable sliding.

Recent numerical results from several representative models are reviewed, with attention to both their critical and their characteristic properties. Some of the relevant notions and related issues are highlighted, including the origin of power laws often observed in statistical properties of earthquakes, apparently contrasting features of characteristic earthquakes or asperities, the nature of precursory phenomena and nucleation processes, and the origin of slow earthquakes, etc.American Physical Society DOI: 10.1103/RevModPhys.84.839 PACS numbers: 91.30.PÀ, 91.30.Px, 46.50.+a, 81.40.Pq CONTENTS I.

As the strain increases, the stress falls from a peak to a much smaller residual stress. Slopes made from such a clay often fail progressively many years after construction. Sliding occurs on a concentrated slip surface, and it is found that the mean resolved shear stress on that surface is markedly less than the peak shear strength. Concepts from fracture mechanics, and in particular the J -integral, are used to derive conditions for the propagation of a concentrated shear band of this kind. The results indicate the presence of a strong size effect, which has important implications for the use of models in soil mechanics. An elastic analysis makes it possible to determine the size of the end zone in which the shear stress on the shear band falls to its residual value. An attempt is made to assess the possible sources of the time-dependence governing propagation speed of the shear band. They include pore-water diffusion to the dilating tip of the band (which governs the rate at which local strength reductions can occur), viscoelastic deformation of the clay (which allows a gradual build-up of strain concentration at the tip of the band), and the weathering break-down of diagenetic bonds.},

For the case of pure adhesion, continuum mechanics models exist which assist in the interpretation of the measurements. In this paper these models are extended to include both static and sliding friction. The approach is through the concept of fracture mechanics, in which the rate of release of elastic strain energy is equated to the work done against surface forces, both frictional and adhesive.

	doi = {10.1029/2006JB004717},
	abstract = {[1] A general theory for transitions between sub-Rayleigh and intersonic rupture speeds is developed for faults governed by slip-weakening friction. The transition occurs when stresses moving at intersonic speeds ahead of expanding or accelerating sub-Rayleigh ruptures exceed the peak strength of the fault, initiating slip within a daughter crack. Upon reaching a critical nucleation length, the daughter crack becomes dynamically unstable, expanding into a self-sustaining intersonic rupture. This mechanism holds in both two and three dimensions. On faults with uniform properties, the seismic S ratio [S = (t p À t 0)/(t 0 À t r)], a measure of the initial loading stress, t 0 , relative to the peak and residual strengths, t p and t r , respectively, must be smaller than some critical value for the transition to occur. The maximum S value for unbounded faults in three dimensions is 1.19, smaller than the value of 1.77 that Andrews (1985) has shown to govern the transition in two dimensions. The supershear transition length (i.e., how far the rupture propagates before reaching intersonic speeds) is proportional to a length scale arising from the friction law governing the nucleation and stability of the daughter crack. A sufficiently narrow fault width suppresses the transition; the critical width is approximately 0.8 times the transition length on an unbounded fault. The transition length is highly sensitive to the form of the slip-weakening law even when the associated fracture energies are identical. Heterogeneous propagation, in the form of abrupt accelerations or increases in stress-release rate, induces stress-wave radiation that can trigger transient bursts of intersonic propagation.

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1517545113},
	abstract = {We study rapidly accelerating rupture fronts at the onset of frictional motion by performing high-temporal-resolution measurements of both the real contact area and the strain fields surrounding the propagating rupture tip. We observe large-amplitude and local-ized shear stress peaks that precede rupture fronts and propagate at the shear-wave speed. These localized stress waves, which retain a well-defined form, are initiated during the rapid rupture acceleration phase. They transport considerable energy and are capable of nucleating a secondary supershear rupture. The ampli-tude of these localized waves roughly scales with the dynamic stress drop and does not decrease as long as the rupture front driving it continues to propagate. Only upon rupture arrest does decay initiate, although the stress wave both continues to propa-gate and retains its characteristic form. These experimental results are qualitatively described by a self-similar model: a simplified analytical solution of a suddenly expanding shear crack. Quanti-tative agreement with experiment is provided by realistic finite-element simulations that demonstrate that the radiated stress waves are strongly focused in the direction of the rupture front propagation and describe both their amplitude growth and spatial scaling. Our results demonstrate the extensive applicability of brittle fracture theory to fundamental understanding of friction. Implica-tions for earthquake dynamics are discussed. nonsteady rupture dynamics {\textbar} acoustic radiation {\textbar} friction {\textbar} earthquake dynamics {\textbar} seismic radiation T he onset of motion along a frictional interface entails rup-ture-front propagation. These rupture fronts have long been considered to have much in common with propagating cracks (1– 3). Recent friction experiments (4) have shown that the stresses and material motion surrounding the tip of a propagating rup-ture are indeed quantitatively described by singular linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) solutions originally developed for brittle shear fracture. These singular fields are only regularized by dissipative and nonlinear processes in the vicinity of the rupture tip. Nonsteady processes such as rapid rupture velocity variation during the nucleation or arrest phases result in the generation of stress-wave radiation (2, 5). In the study of earthquakes, un-derstanding the source mechanism of those waves is of primary importance. Long-wavelength radiation is usually described by simple dislocation models (3, 6). High-frequency radiation, how-ever, was proposed (2) to be controlled by the strong slip velocity concentrations at the rupture tip predicted by fracture mechanics. Descriptions that go beyond singular contributions to fracture involve significant analytical complications; full solutions of non-steady dynamic crack problems are generally extremely difficult to obtain. Of the few full-field analytic solutions available, self-similar solutions of suddenly expanding shear cracks have provided much intuition (2, 5, 7, 8). These solutions, under shear loading (mode II), predict a localized shear stress peak that propagates ahead of the rupture tip at the shear-wave velocity. The results obtained in such solutions are generally considered as an upper bound for the realistic stress-wave radiation of smoothly accelerating ruptures. Radiated shear stress peaks have, for decades, drawn special at-tention, because they are thought to be an important vehicle for the nucleation of supershear ruptures, a class of ruptures that propagate beyond the shear-wave speed, C S . These ruptures sur-pass the Rayleigh wave speed, C R , the classic " speed limit " for rapid singular cracks. This idea was first postulated in ref. 1 and later numerically observed in ref. 9, who found that a sufficiently strong shear stress peak can overcome interfacial strength and nucleate a daughter crack that will propagate at supershear ve-locities (10–15). Such supershear ruptures have indeed been observed along natural fault planes (16, 17) and in laboratory experiments (18–21). Despite their importance, experimental studies of radiated stress waves have been very limited. Here we present direct measurements of the stress fields surrounding the tips of rapidly propagating ruptures and show how a shear stress peak is formed. Supplementing experiments with finite-element calculations, we provide a detailed description of both the scaling and space–time structure of this phenomenon.},

	title = {Earthquakes and friction laws},
	volume = {391},
	abstract = {Earthquakes have long been recognized as resulting from a stick–slip frictional instability. The development of a full constitutive law for rock friction now shows that the gamut of earthquake phenomena—seismogenesis and seismic coupling, pre-and post-seismic phenomena, and the insensitivity of earthquakes to stress transients—all appear as manifestations of the richness of this friction law. The traditional view of tectonics is that the lithosphere comprises a strong brittle layer overlying a weak ductile layer, which gives rise to two forms of deformation: brittle fracture, accompanied by earth-quakes, in the upper layer, and aseismic ductile flow in the layer beneath. Although this view is not incorrect, it is imprecise, and in ways that can lead to serious misunderstandings. The term ductility, for example, can apply equally to two common rock deformation mechanisms: crystal plasticity, which occurs in rock above a critical temperature, and cataclastic flow, a type of granular deformation which can occur in poorly consolidated sediments. Although both exhibit ductility, these two deformation mechanisms have very different rheologies. Earthquakes, in turn, are associated with strength and brittleness—associations that are likewise sufficiently imprecise that, if taken much beyond the generality implied in the opening sentence, they can lead to serious misinterpretations about earthquake mechanics. Lately, a newer, much more precise and predictive model for the earthquake mechanism has emerged, which has its roots in the observation that tectonic earthquakes seldom if ever occur by the sudden appearance and propagation of a new shear crack (or 'fault'). Instead, they occur by sudden slippage along a pre-existing fault or plate interface. They are therefore a frictional, rather than fracture, phenomenon, with brittle fracture playing a secondary role in the lengthening of faults 1 and frictional wear},

We directly observe slip-pulses, highly localized slip accompanied by large local reduction of the normal stress near the rupture tip. These pulses propagate in the direction of motion of the softer material at a selected (maximal) velocity and continuously evolve while propagating. In the opposite direction bimaterial coupling favors crack-like 'supershear' fronts. The robustness of these structures shows the importance of bimaterial coupling to frictional motion and modes of frictional dissipation.},

The ratio of the maximum static friction force to the loading force is called the static friction coefficient µM, which is considered to be a constant. Here, we conduct experiments demonstrating that the static friction force of a slider on a substrate follows a novel friction law under certain conditions. The magnitude of µM decreases as the loading force increases or as the apparent contact area decreases. This behavior is caused by the slip of local precursors before the onset of bulk sliding and is consistent with recent theory.

	abstract = {A substantial effort has been devoted in the past toward modeling earthquake source mechanisms as dynamically extending shear cracks. Most of the attention was focused on the subsonic crack speed regime. Recently, a number of reports have appeared in the seismological literature citing evidence of intersonic rupture speeds during shallow crustal earthquakes. In the first part of this paper, we discuss direct experimental observations of intersonic in-plane shear crack growth along a weak plane joining two homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic plates. Associated with the primary intersonic crack and at locations behind the propagating shear crack tip, a series of secondary tensile cracks, at a steep angle to the shear crack plane, were also observed. Motivated by these observations, subsonic and intersonic mode II crack propagation with a velocity weakening cohesive zone is analyzed in the main body of the paper. A cohesive law is assumed wherein the cohesive shear traction is either a constant or decreases linearly with the local slip rate, the rate of decrease governed by a slip rate weakening parameter. The cohesive shear traction is assumed to vanish when the crack tip sliding displacement reaches a characteristic breakdown slip. It is shown that a positive energy flux into the rupture front is possible in the entire intersonic regime. The influence of shear strength and of the weakening parameter on the crack propagation behavior is investigated. Crack tip stability issues are also addressed, and favorable speed regimes are identified. Estimates of the slip rate weakening parameter are obtained by using the theoretical model to predict the angle of the secondary cracks. The rest of the parameters are subsequently estimated by comparing the isochromatic fringe patterns (contours of maximum in-plane shear stress) predicted by the solution with those recorded experimentally.},

A sparse population of strong bonds connects molecules together and prevents macroscopic flow. In this review we discuss the current state of the art on how these soft materials break and detach from solid surfaces. We focus on how stresses and strains are localized near the fracture plane and how elastic energy can flow from the bulk of the material to the crack tip. Adhesion of pressure-sensitive-adhesives, fracture of gels and rubbers are specifically addressed and the key concepts are pointed out. We define the important length scales in the problem and in particular the elasto-adhesive length Γ/E where Γ is the fracture energy and E is the elastic modulus, and how the ratio between sample size and Γ/E controls the fracture mechanisms. Theoretical concepts bridging solid mechanics and polymer physics are rationalized and illustrated by micromechanical experiments and mechanisms of fracture are described in detail. Open questions and emerging concepts are discussed at the end of the review.},

	abstract = {In the past, analytical models have been developed for the study of rapid crack growth in a rate-dependent elastic-plastic material under conditions that permit crack advance in a cleavage mode, and separately for rapid crack advance in an elastic-plastic material when the crack advances by means of a local ductile mechanism. However, models suitable for study of rapid crack growth that permit either mode of crack advance, with the operative mode being determined by which of two competing fracture criteria prevails, have been elusive. Here, the process of dynamic tensile crack growth in a material is studied under small scale yielding conditions with the crack tip plastic zone modeled as a strip yield zone extending ahead of the advancing crack tip. Following Glennie [1] and others, rate dependence of plastic flow is taken into account by assuming that the cohesive stress in the yield zone depends linearly on the local rate of opening of the yield zone. The conditions under which a crack can advance steadily according to either of two criteria are considered. A crack tip opening criterion is identified with a locally ductile mode, and a critical stress condition is identified with a cleavage mode. The analysis leads to conditions among the applied stress intensity factor, the crack speed and the material viscosity that are necessary for sustained crack growth in either case, with the implication that the criterion that is easiest to satisfy will establish the mode by which the crack advances.},

This mechanism was further invoked to explain the remote triggering of earthquakes or abnormally large landslides or pyroclastic flows runout. Recent experimental and theoretical work pointed out the velocity of vibration as the key parameter which governs frictional weakening in sheared granular media. Here we show that the grains mobility is not mandatory, and that the vibration velocity governs both granular and solid frictional weakening. The velocity threshold controlling the transition from stick-slip motion to continuous sliding is of the same order of magnitude, namely a hundred microns per second. It is linked to the roughness distribution of the asperities at the contact surface.},

	abstract = {A B S T R A C T We investigate the effect of fault surface roughness on rupture preparation characteristics using meter-scale metagabbro specimens. We repeatedly conducted the experiments with the same pair of rock specimens to make the fault surface rough. We obtained three experimental results under the same experimental conditions (6.7 MPa of normal stress and 0.01 mm/s of loading rate) but at different roughness conditions (smooth, mod-erately roughened, and heavily roughened). During each experiment, we observed many stick-slip events pre-ceded by precursory slow slip. We investigated when and where slow slip initiated by using the strain gauge data processed by the Kalman filter algorithm. The observed rupture preparation processes on the smooth fault (i.e. the first experiment among the three) showed high repeatability of the spatiotemporal distributions of slow slip initiation. Local stress measurements revealed that slow slip initiated around the region where the ratio of shear to normal stress (τ/σ) was the highest as expected from finite element method (FEM) modeling. However, the exact location of slow slip initiation was where τ/σ became locally minimum, probably due to the frictional heterogeneity. In the experiment on the moderately roughened fault, some irregular events were observed, though the basic characteristics of other regular events were similar to those on the smooth fault. Local stress data revealed that the spatiotemporal characteristics of slow slip initiation and the resulting τ/σ drop for irre-gular events were different from those for regular ones even under similar stress conditions. On the heavily roughened fault, the location of slow slip initiation was not consistent with τ/σ anymore because of the highly heterogeneous static friction on the fault, which also decreased the repeatability of spatiotemporal distributions of slow slip initiation. These results suggest that fault surface roughness strongly controls the rupture preparation process, and generally increases its complexity with the degree of roughness.},

	abstract = {We investigated the shear strain field ahead of a supershear rupture. The strain array data along the sliding fault surfaces were obtained during the large-scale biaxial friction experiments at the National Re-search Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resil-ience. These friction experiments were done using a pair of meter-scale metagabbro rock specimens whose sim-ulated fault area was 1.5 m × 0.1 m. A 2.6-MPa normal stress was applied with loading velocity of 0.1 mm/s. Near-fault strain was measured by 32 two-component semiconductor strain gauges installed at an interval of 50 mm and 10 mm off the fault and recorded at an interval of 1 MHz. Many stick-slip events were ob-served in the experiments. We chose ten unilateral rup-ture events that propagated with supershear rupture ve-locity without preceding foreshocks. Focusing on the rupture front, stress concentration was observed and sharp stress drop occurred immediately inside the rup-tured area. The temporal variation of strain array data is converted to the spatial variation of strain assuming a constant rupture velocity. We picked up the peak strain and zero-crossing strain locations to measure the cohe-sive zone length. By compiling the stick-slip event data, the cohesive zone length is about 50 mm although it scattered among the events. We could not see any sys-tematic variation at the location but some dependence on the rupture velocity. The cohesive zone length de-creases as the rupture velocity increases, especially larg-er than ffiffi ffi 2 p times the shear wave velocity. This feature is consistent with the theoretical prediction.},

	abstract = {We discuss dynamic rupture results aiming to elucidate the generation mechanism of pulverized fault zone rocks (PFZR) observed in 100–200 m wide belts distributed asymmetrically across major strike-slip faults separating different crustal blocks. Properties of subshear and supershear ruptures are considered using analytical results of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics and numerical simulations of Mode-II ruptures along faults between similar or dissimilar solids. The dynamic fields of bimaterial subshear ruptures are expected to produce off-fault damage primarily on the stiff side of the fault, with tensile cracks having no preferred orientation, in agreement with field observations. Subshear ruptures in a homogeneous solid are expected to produce off-fault damage with high-angle tensile cracks on the extensional side of the fault, while supershear ruptures between similar or dissimilar solids are likely to produce off-fault damage on both sides of the fault with preferred tensile crack orientations. One or more of these features are not consistent with properties of natural samples of PFZR. At a distance of about 100 m from the fault, subshear and supershear ruptures without stress singularities produce strain rates up to 1 s−1. This is less than required for rock pulverization in laboratory experiments with centimetre-scale intact rock samples, but may be sufficient for pulverizing larger samples with pre-existing damage},

Recent geophysical and laboratory observations indicated that interfacial failure can be mediated by slow slip rupture phenomena which are distinct from ordinary, earthquake-like, fast rupture. These discoveries have influenced the way we think about frictional motion, yet the nature and properties of slow rupture are not completely understood. We show that slow rupture is an intrinsic and robust property of simple non-monotonic rate-and-state friction laws. It is associated with a new velocity scale \$c\_\{min\}\$, determined by the friction law, below which steady state rupture cannot propagate. We further show that rupture can occur in a continuum of states, spanning a wide range of velocities from \$c\_\{min\}\$ to elastic wave-speeds, and predict different properties for slow rupture and ordinary fast rupture. Our results are qualitatively consistent with recent high-resolution laboratory experiments and may provide a theoretical framework for understanding slow rupture phenomena along frictional interfaces.},

	abstract = {Stresses well below the critical fracture stress can lead to highly unpredictable delayed fracture after a long period of seemingly quiescent stability. Delayed fracture is a major threat to the lifetime of materials, and its unpredictability makes it difficult to prevent. This is exacerbated by the lack of consensus on the microscopic mechanisms at its origin because unambiguous experimental proof of these mechanisms remains absent. We present an experimental approach to measure, with high spatial and temporal resolution, the local deforma-tions that precipitate crack nucleation. We apply this method to study delayed fracture in an elastomer and find that a delocalized zone of very small strains emerges as a consequence of strongly localized damage processes. This prefracture deformation zone grows exponentially in space and time, ultimately culminating in the nucle-ation of a crack and failure of the material as a whole. Our results paint a microscopic picture of the elusive origins of delayed fracture and open the way to detect damage well before it manifests macroscopically.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the interest in the problem of brittle fracture and, in particular, in the theory of cracks has grown appreciably in connection with various technical applications. Numerous investigations have been carried out, enlarging in essential points the classical concepts of cracks and methods of analysis. The qualitative features of the problems of cracks, associated with their peculiar nonlinearity as revealed in these investigations, makes the theory of cracks stand out distinctly from the whole range of problems in terms of the theory of elasticity. The chapter presents a unified view of the way basic problems in the theory of equilibrium cracks are formulated and discusses the results obtained thereby. The object of the theory of equilibrium cracks is the study of the equilibrium of solids in the presence of cracks. However, there exists a fundamental distinction between these two problems, The form of a cavity undergoes only slight changes even under a considerable variation in the load acting on a body, while the cracks whose surface also constitutes a part of the body boundary can expand even with small increase of the load to which the body is subjected.},

	abstract = {The sliding of a solid object on a solid substrate requires a shear force that is larger than the maximum static friction force. It is commonly believed that the maximum static friction force is proportional to the loading force and does not depend on the apparent contact area. The ratio of the maximum static friction force to the loading force is called the static friction coefficient m M , which is considered to be a constant. Here, we conduct experiments demonstrating that the static friction force of a slider on a substrate follows a novel friction law under certain conditions. The magnitude of m M decreases as the loading force increases or as the apparent contact area decreases. This behavior is caused by the slip of local precursors before the onset of bulk sliding and is consistent with recent theory. The results of this study will develop novel methods for static friction control. T he application of a shear force larger than the maximum static friction force to a slider on a base block causes the slider to start sliding. A kinetic friction force is exerted on the slider in the sliding state. Friction appears in various systems ranging from atomic to geological scales and has been studied since ancient times 1–6 . From an engineering perspective, friction control is critical to the effective functioning of machines and can enable advances in energy and global warming problems 4–6 . In the 15th century, da Vinci discovered that the friction force is proportional to the loading force and does not depend on the apparent contact area between two solid objects. About 200 years later, Amontons rediscovered these results, which are now collectively called Amontons' law. This law is commonly believed to hold well for diverse systems, discussed in high school textbook, and used to achieve friction control for various machines. The ratio of the maximum static friction force to the loading force is called the static friction coefficient. When Amontons' law holds, this ratio is a constant that does not depend on the loading force or the apparent contact area. Friction mechanisms are usually explained as follows 1–6},

This intriguing precursory activity is not accounted for by traditional friction theories but is extremely important for friction dominated geophysical phenomena as earthquakes, landslides or avalanches. Here we simulate the onset of slip of a three dimensional elastic body resting on a surface and show that experimentally observed frictional precursors depend in a complex non-universal way on the sample geometry and loading conditions. Our model satisfies Archard's law and Amontons' first and second laws, reproducing with remarkable precision the real contact area dynamics, the precursors' envelope dynamics prior to sliding, and the normal and shear internal stress distributions close to the interfacial surface. Moreover, it allows to assess which features can be attributed to the elastic equilibrium, and which are attributed to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics, suggesting that precursory activity is an intrinsically quasi-static physical process. A direct calculation of the evolution of the Coulomb stress before and during precursors nucleation shows large variations across the sample, explaining why earthquake forecasting methods based only on accumulated slip and Coulomb stress monitoring are often ineffective.},

It also enables the engineering of arbitrarily shaped two-and three-dimensional objects with tunable mechanical response. In contrast with the extensive body of related empirical knowledge and despite a growing industrial interest, the physical ingredients underlying these intriguing mechanical properties remain poorly understood. To make some progress in this direction, we study a model tricot made of a single elastic thread knitted into a common pattern called stockinette. On the one hand, we experimentally investigate its tensile response and measure local displacements of the stitches during deformation. On the other hand, we derive a first-principle mechanical model for the displacement field based on the yarn-bending energy, the conservation of its total length, and the topological constraints on the constitutive stitches. Our model solves both the shape and mechanical response of the knit and agrees quantitatively with our measurements. This study thus provides a fundamental framework for the understanding of knitted fabrics, paving the way to thread-based smart materials.},

A thick layer of sand on a circular track was forced by a rolling wheel on an arm whose weight and moment of inertia could be varied. We compared the ripples made by the rolling wheel to those made using a simple inclined plow blade. We investigated the dependence of the critical speed on various parameters and described a scaling argument that leads to a dimensionless ratio, analogous to the hydrodynamic Froude number, which controls the instability. This represents the crossover between conservative dynamic forces and dissipative static forces. Above onset wheel-driven ripples move in the direction of motion of the wheel, but plow-driven ripples move in the reverse direction for a narrow range of Froude numbers.},

	abstract = {Vegetation gap patterns in arid grasslands, such as the " fairy cir-cles " of Namibia, are one of nature's greatest mysteries and sub-ject to a lively debate on their origin. They are characterized by small-scale hexagonal ordering of circular bare-soil gaps that persists uniformly in the landscape scale to form a homogeneous distribution. Pattern-formation theory predicts that such highly ordered gap pat-terns should be found also in other water-limited systems across the globe, even if the mechanisms of their formation are different. Here we report that so far unknown fairy circles with the same spatial structure exist 10,000 km away from Namibia in the remote outback of Australia. Combining fieldwork, remote sensing, spatial pattern analysis, and process-based mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that these patterns emerge by self-organization, with no correlation with termite activity; the driving mechanism is a positive biomass– water feedback associated with water runoff and biomass-dependent infiltration rates. The remarkable match between the patterns of Australian and Namibian fairy circles and model results indicate that both patterns emerge from a nonuniform stationary instability, sup-porting a central universality principle of pattern-formation theory. Applied to the context of dryland vegetation, this principle predicts that different systems that go through the same instability type will show similar vegetation patterns even if the feedback mechanisms and resulting soil–water distributions are different, as we indeed found by comparing the Australian and the Namibian fairy-circle eco-systems. These results suggest that biomass–water feedbacks and resultant vegetation gap patterns are likely more common in remote drylands than is currently known. drylands {\textbar} spatial pattern {\textbar} Triodia grass {\textbar} Turing instability {\textbar}},

While the conditions for the transition from sub-Rayleigh to supershear propagation have been studied extensively, little is known about what dictates supershear rupture speeds and how the interplay between the stresses that drive propagation and interface properties that resist motion affects them. By combining laboratory experiments and numerical simulations that reflect natural earthquakes, we find that supershear rupture propagation speeds can be predicted and described by a fracture mechanics-based equation of motion. This equation of motion quantitatively predicts rupture speeds, with the velocity selection dictated by the interface properties and stress. Our results reveal a critical rupture length, analogous to Griffith's length for sub-Rayleigh cracks, below which supershear propagation is impossible. Above this critical length, supershear ruptures can exist, once excited, even for extremely low preexisting stress levels. These results significantly improve our fundamental understanding of what governs the speed of supershear earthquakes, with direct and important implications for interpreting their unique supershear seismic radiation patterns.},

	abstract = {The near field ground motion signatures associated with sub-Rayleigh and supershear ruptures are investigated using the laboratory earthquake experiment originally developed by Rosakis and coworkers (Xia et al., 2004, 2005a; Lu et al., 2007; Rosakis et al., 2007). Heterodyne laser interferometers enable continuous, high bandwidth measurements of fault-normal (FN) and fault-parallel (FP) particle velocity "ground motion" records at discrete locations on the surface of a Homalite test specimen as a sub-Rayleigh or a supershear rupture sweeps along the frictional fault. Photoelastic interference fringes, acquired using high-speed digital photography, provide a synchronized, spatially resolved, whole field view of the advancing rupture tip and surrounding maximum shear stress field. Experimental results confirm that near field ground motion records associated with the passage of a sub-Rayleigh rupture are characterized by a FN velocity swing which dominates over the FP velocity swing. The situation is shown to reverse in the supershear rupture speed regime whereby the motion along the shear Mach front is characterized by a FP particle velocity swing which dominates over the FN velocity swing. Additional distinguishing particle velocity signatures, consistent with theoretical and numerical predictions, and repeatedly observed in experimental records are (1) a pronounced peak in the FP velocity record, induced by the leading dilatational field, which sweeps the measurement station just prior to the arrival of the shear Mach front, and (2) a pronounced velocity swing in the FN record associated with the arrival of a "trailing Rayleigh disturbance", which sweeps the measurement station following passage of the shear Mach front. Each of these features are addressed in detail. We conclude by reexamining the 2002, Mw7.9 Denali fault earthquake and the remarkable set of ground motion records obtained at Pump Station 10 (PS10), located approximately 85km east of the epicenter and 3km north of the fault along the Alaska Pipeline. Motivated by the analysis and thorough interpretation of these records by Dunham and Archuleta (2004, 2005), we attempt to replicate the Denali ground motion signatures using a laboratory earthquake experiment. The experiments feature a left (west) to right (east) propagating right lateral rupture within the Homalite test specimen with particle velocity data collected at a near-field station situated just above (north of) the fault, (on the compressional quadrant) in order to simulate the PS10 scenario. Both sub-Rayleigh and supershear laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted using the "Denali PS10" configuration in order to compare and contrast the resulting particle velocity signatures. Results from the supershear experiment capture the prominent FN and FP ground motion signatures and corresponding sense of particle motion revealed in the PS10 ground motion records. Most notably, the particle velocity records feature a dominant FP component coinciding with the arrival of the shear Mach front, followed by a pronounced velocity swing in the FN component coinciding with the passage of a trailing Rayleigh disturbance, as independently confirmed by the presence of these features and their noted arrival times in the synchronized photoelastic image sequence. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Despite the apparent ease with which a sheet of paper is crumpled and tossed away, crumpling dynamics are often considered a paradigm of complexity 1-5. This complexity arises from the infinite number of configurations a disordered crumpled sheet can take. Here we experimentally show that key aspects of crumpling have a very simple description; the evolution of the damage in crumpling dynamics can largely be described by a single global quantity-the total length of all creases. We follow the evolution of the damage network in repetitively crumpled elastoplastic sheets, and show that the dynamics of this quantity are deterministic, and depend only on the instantaneous state of the crease network and not at all on the crumpling history. We also show that this global quantity captures the crumpling dynamics of a sheet crumpled for the first time. This leads to a remarkable reduction in complexity, allowing a description of a highly disordered system by a single state parameter. Similar strategies may also be useful in analyzing other systems that evolve under geometric and mechanical constraints, from faulting of tectonic plates to the evolution of proteins.},

We experimentally show that this very strong interaction, which leads to the production of fluid motion at very fine scales, uncovers direct evidence of a novel iterative cascade of instabilities in a bulk fluid. When the coherent vortex cores approach each other, they deform into tent-like structures, and the mutual strain causes them to locally flatten into extremely thin vortex sheets. These sheets then break down into smaller secondary vortex filaments, which themselves rapidly flatten and break down into even smaller tertiary filaments. By performing numerical simulations of the full Navier-Stokes equations, we also resolve one iteration of this instability and highlight the subtle role that viscosity must play in the rupturing of a vortex sheet. The concurrence of this observed iterative cascade of instabilities over various scales with those of recent theoretical predictions could provide a new mechanistic framework in which the evolution of turbulent flows can be examined in real-time as a series of discrete dynamic instabilities.},

	abstract = {Characteristic features of local breakdown near a propagating crack-tip during slip failure nucleation and its transition process to unstable rupture under mode II conditions are experimentally studied using a rock sample with a simulated fault, the size of which is large compared with the size of the breakdown zone. In addition, distinctive features in the nucleation zone are compared with those in the zone of steady, dynamic rupture propagation. It is found that the local breakdown stress drop, the local dynamic stress drop, the local stress increase immediately before the slip-weakening process, the dimensionless parameter S defined by Das and Aki, and the shear fracture energy are functions of crack length in the transition zone from nucleation to unstable rupture; i.e., they all increase with crack growth in the nucleation zone. This is contrasted with the observations in the zone of steady dynamic rupture propagation, where these physical parameters do not depend on crack length. An increase in the magnitudes of these parameters with crack growth in the nucleation zone results in increasing resistance to crack extension with crack growth in the nucleation zone. The reason for the increase in crack growth resistance in this zone is that a slip failure nucleus is formed at a point (or zone) where the local strength and the shear fracture energy are at a minimum. This basic physical information can provide the key to earthquake prediction, since the nucleation itself is a precursory phenomenon. The ratio of the size of the breakdown zone to the crack length decreases abruptly beyond the critical crack length. Rupture velocity v accelerates with crack growth, and reaches the shear wave velocity or super-shear, and v is found to be expressed empirically as a function of crack length in the nucleation zone. A positive correlation is found between S and v in the nucleation zone (v increases with increasing S). However, no such correlation was observed in the zone of steady, dynamic rupture propagation, where v seems to have reached the shear wave velocity of super-shear for S = 0.5. This is consistent with Das and Aki's numerical result. The interrelationships between shear stress, slip displacement, slip velocity and acceleration near the crack-tip during the breakdown in the nucleation zone are revealed, and they are compared with those in the zone of dynamic rupture propagation. The present experiments suggest that the relationship between shear stress and slip displacement is more fundamental during the breakdown process than the relationship between shear stress and slip velocity. A model is presented to describe the breakdown process in the nucleation zone},

	abstract = {To understand constitutive behavior near the rupture front during an earthquake source shear failure along a preexisting fault in terms of physics, local breakdown processes near the propagating tip of the slipping zone under mode II crack growth condition have been investigated experimentally and theoretically. A physically reasonable constitutive relation between cohesive stress τ and slip displacement D, τ = (τ i − τ d )[1 + α log (1 + βD)] exp (η D) + τ d , is put forward to describe dynamic breakdown processes during earthquake source failure in quantitative terms. In the above equation, τ i , is the initial shear stress on the verge of slip, τ d is the dynamic friction stress, and α, β, and η are constants. This relation is based on the constitutive features during slip failure instabilities revealed in the careful laboratory experiments. These experiments show that the shear stress first increases with ongoing slip during the dynamic breakdown process, the peak stress is attained at a very (usually negligibly) small but nonzero value of the slip displacement, and then the slip-weakening instability proceeds. The model leads to bounded slip acceleration and stresses at and near the dynamically propagating tip of the slipping zone along the fault in an elastic continuum. The dynamic behavior near the propagating tip of the slipping zone calculated from the theoretical model agrees with those observed during slip failure along the preexisting fault much larger than the cohesive zone. The model predicts that the maximum slip acceleration D ¨ max be related to the maximum slip velocity D ˙ max and the critical displacement Dc by D ¨ max = k D ˙ max 2 / D c , where k is a numerical parameter, taking a value ranging from 4.9 to 7.2 according to a value of τ i /τ p (τ p being the peak shear stress) in the present model. The model further predicts that D ¨ max be expressed in terms of D ˙ max and the cut off frequency f max s of the power spectral density of the slip acceleration on the fault plane as D ¨ max = ( 3.6 ∼ 4.4 ) D ˙ max f max s and that D ˙ max in terms of Dc and f max s as D ˙ max = ( 0.6 ∼ 0.9 ) D c f max s . These theoretical relations agree well with the experimental observations and can explain interrelations between strong motion source parameters for earthquakes. The pulse width of slip acceleration on the fault plane is directly proportional to the time Tc required for the crack tip to break down, and f max s is inversely proportional to Tc.},

In the experimental phase of the study, coherent gradient sensing (CGS) has been used to study dynamic fracture in C300 maraging steel. The specimens were subjected to three-point bend impact loading under a drop weight tower. High-speed photographs of the CGS interferograms were analyzed to determine the crack tip location, the velocity and the dynamic fracture toughness as a function of time. Post-mortem examination of the specimens revealed the fractography of the fracture surfaces, including the development of shear lips. In a parallel numerical phase of the study, fracture has been modeled by recourse to an irreversible cohesive law embedded into cohesive elements. These cohesive elements govern all aspects of the separation and closure of the incipient cracks. The cohesive behavior of the material is assumed to be rate independent. The finite element model is three dimensional and consists of quadratic ten-noded tetrahedra. The numerical simulations have proven highly predictive of a number of observed features, including: the crack growth initiation time; the trajectory of the propagating crack tip; and the formation of shear lips near the lateral surfaces. The simulations therefore establish the feasibility of using cohesive models of fracture and cohesive elements to predict dynamic crack-growth initiation and propagation in three dimensions. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	title = {Energy {Dissipation} in {Dynamic} {Fracture}},
	abstract = {Measurements in PMMA of both the energy flux into the tip of a moving crack and the total surface area created via the microbranching instability indicate that the instability is the main mechanism for energy dissipation by a moving crack in brittle, amorphous material. Beyond the instability onset, the rate of fracture surface creation is proportional to the energy flux into the crack. At high velocities microbranches create nearly an order of magnitude larger fracture surface than smooth cracks. This mechanism provides an explanation for why the theoretical limiting velocity of a crack is never realized. PACS numbers: 68.35.Gy, 62.20.Mk, 83.50.Tq Although the subject of much research over the past decades, the fracture of brittle amorphous materials remains in many ways not understood. Of particular interest is the mechanism by which energy in the system is dissipated. Experimental measurements of the flow of energy into the tip of a running crack [1] have indicated that the fracture energy (i.e., the energy needed to create a unit extension of a crack) is a strong function of the crack's velocity and that the majority of the energy stored in the system prior to the onset of fracture ends up as heat [2]. In this Letter we present quantitative measurements indicating that this increased dissipation is due entirely to the onset of a microbranching instability [3,4] which occurs at a critical value y c of the velocity y. As y increases beyond y c we find that the energy needed to create micro-branches is precisely enough to account for the velocity dependence of the fracture energy. The long-standing problem of the limiting velocity of a crack is also explained by this mechanism. While linear elastic theory predicts that a crack should continuously accelerate up to the Rayleigh wave speed V R , experiments in a number of brittle materials [5] show that a crack will seldom reach even half of this value. As we will show, the total amount of fracture surface created by both the main crack and the microbranches increases rapidly with y. Thus, rather than acceleration, increased driving results in increased ramification of structure below the fracture surface. There have been a number of suggestions for the velocity dependence of fracture energy. One view is that the energy flow into the tip of a single moving crack is dissipated by plastic deformation around the crack tip. Depending on the model used to describe the area of deformation around the tip, either a nonmonotonic or monotonically increasing function [6] of the velocity of the crack can result. An alternative view of the dissipation process was suggested by Ravi-Chandar and Knauss [7]. They viewed the fracture process as the coalescence of preexisting microvoids or defects situated in the path of the crack and activated by the intense stress field at the crack tip. An increase in the energy flux to the tip, in this picture, causes an increase in the number of microcracks formed and thereby enhanced dissipation. This picture suggests that crack propagation via interacting microvoids occurs as a randomly activated process. Recent experiments [4] on brittle PMMA (polymethyl-methacrylate) offer a different view. The formation and evolution of microcracks were seen to be the result of a dynamic instability of a moving crack. A sharp transition from a single propagating crack to an ensemble of cracks occurs above the critical velocity of y c 0.36V R when a single crack sprouts small microscopic side branches (microbranches). As a function of the velocity y, these branches grow as the mean dynamics of a crack change dramatically; the mean acceleration drops, the velocity develops oscillations, and structure is formed on the fracture surface [3,8]. There have been a number of recent theoretical attempts to model this instability, both on a mesoscopic scale [9] as well as in the context of lattice models [10] and finite element calculations [11], where local crack branching at a critical velocity has been observed. Many of the experimental results have also been observed in molecular dynamic simulations [12]. In this Letter we measure both the mean energy flux into the crack tip and the total surface area formed as a function of the velocity of a crack. We find that the total surface area, resulting from the dynamic generation of microbranches above y c , increases linearly with the energy flux into the crack tip. This mechanism thus provides a simple dynamical description of the apparent velocity dependence of the fracture energy (or energy dissipation by the crack). We also find that the fluctuations in the crack velocity are proportional to the energy flux into the tip, supporting the view that velocity fluctuations result from the dynamic transfer of energy between the main crack and the frustrated local branches. The experimental apparatus is similar to that described in [3]. Our experiments were conducted in thin, quasi-2D sheets of brittle, cast PMMA [13] having a thickness of 0031-90079676(12)2117(4)\$10.00},

	abstract = {A NEW REPRESENTATION, based on the solution of a diffraction problem given by F. G. Friedlander, is presented for the stress field produced by a semi-infinite accelerating crack in a longitudinal shear field. This is employed to give an explicit expression for the field at any point generated by an incident plane stress wave and also to obtain asymptotic expressions for the components of strain and velocity near the crack tip when the crack is loaded in any prescribed manner. The relationship of the Griffith-Irwin energy balance to the Dugdale-Barenblatt model of small-scale yielding is next examined, and it is concluded that the Griffith-Irwin energy balance is acceptable for ail but the most rapid loading conditions, provided the yielding is small-scale. Finally, some effects of large-scale yielding are investigated by adopting the Dugdale model, with a plastic zone of finite size, the motion of a crack subjected to a step load being investigated in detail. An important simplifying approximation, which is adequate in this case and likely also to be so in most practical contexts, is noted, which very drastically reduces the complexity of the mathematical analysis. It is concluded that a crack with a finite plastic zone accelerates less rapidly than one for which the yielding is small-scale, although the accelerations predicted are still unrealistically high. It is expected that this defect will be remedied by the future inclusion of rate-dependence into the model.},

This prediction is quantitatively consistent with data from laboratory experiments conducted on dry rocks at constant slip rate. We also estimate G for crack-like ruptures propagating at constant speed and find that G ∝ í µí»¿ 2∕3 in the large slip limit. Quantitative estimates of G in that regime tend to be several orders of magnitude lower than seismologically inferred values of G. We conclude that while flash heating provides a consistent explanation for the observed dynamic weakening in laboratory experiments with kinematically imposed slip, its contribution to the energy dissipation during earthquakes becomes negligible for large events when considering the elastodynamic coupling between strength and slip evolution.},

These effects are well-described by empirical rate-and state-dependent constitutive formulations which have been utilized for analysis of fault slip and earthquake processes.

The observations reveal that frictional state dependence represents an increase of contact area with contact age. Transient changes of sliding resistance correlate with changes in contact area and arise from shifts of contact population age. Displacement-dependent replacement of contact populations is shown to cause the diagnostic evolution of friction over a characteristic sliding distance that occurs whenever slip begins or sliding conditions change.},

We first analyze in detail the behavior of friction at interfaces between macroscopic hard rough solids, whose main dynamical features are well described by the Rice-Ruina rate and state-dependent constitutive law. We show that it results from two combined effects: (i) the threshold rheology of nanometer-thick junctions jammed under confinement into a soft glassy structure and (ii) the geometric aging, i.e. slow growth of the real area of contact via asperity creep interrupted by sliding. Closer analysis leads to identifying a second aging-rejuvenation process, at work within the junctions themselves. We compare the effects of structural aging at such multicontact, very highly confined, interfaces with those met under different confinement levels, namely boundary lubricated contacts and extended adhesive interfaces involving soft materials (hydrogels, elastomers). This leads us to propose a classification of frictional junctions in terms of the relative importance of jamming and adsorption-induced metastability.},

Numerous investigations have been carried out, enlarging in essential points the classical concepts of cracks and methods of analysis. The qualitative features of the problems of cracks, associated with their peculiar nonlinearity as revealed in these investigations, makes the theory of cracks stand out distinctly from the whole range of problems in terms of the theory of elasticity. The chapter presents a unified view of the way basic problems in the theory of equilibrium cracks are formulated and discusses the results obtained thereby. The object of the theory of equilibrium cracks is the study of the equilibrium of solids in the presence of cracks. However, there exists a fundamental distinction between these two problems, The form of a cavity undergoes only slight changes even under a considerable variation in the load acting on a body, while the cracks whose surface also constitutes a part of the body boundary can expand even with small increase of the load to which the body is subjected.},

	volume = {104},
	abstract = {Theoretical studies have shown that the issue of rupture modes has important implications for fault constitutive laws, stress conditions on faults, energy partition and heat generation during earthquakes , scaling laws, and spatiotemporal complexity of fault slip. Early theoretical models treated earthquakes as crack-like ruptures , but seismic inversions indicate that earthquake ruptures may propagate in a self-healing pulse-like mode. A number of explanations for the existence of slip pulses have been proposed and continue to be vigorously debated. This study presents experimental observations of spontaneous pulse-like ruptures in a homogeneous linear-elastic setting that mimics crustal earthquakes; reveals how different rupture modes are selected based on the level of fault prestress; demonstrates that both rupture modes can transition to supershear speeds; and advocates, based on comparison with theoretical studies, the importance of velocity-weakening friction for earthquake dynamics. earthquake physics mechanics of faulting rupture modes shear cracks velocity-dependent friction D estructive large earthquakes occur as dynamic frictional ruptures along preexisting interfaces (or faults) in the Earth's crust. Inversions of seismic and other field observations have significantly advanced our understanding of earthquake ruptures. At the same time, detailed inversions often are impossible due to limited data availability or limited knowledge of the structure and properties of the crust. Numerical modeling of earthquakes helps pinpoint potential rupture scenarios but, in turn, requires a number of still poorly known inputs that are being actively researched. Such inputs include fault friction laws and initial stress conditions. This reality highlights the need for highly instrumented laboratory experiments that reproduce some of the basic physics governing rupture dynamics of crustal earthquakes while preserving enough simplicity so that clear conclusions can be obtained by direct observation. One example of such experiments is the work of Xia et al. (1, 2), which has demonstrated the ability of spontaneous dynamic ruptures to transition from sub-Rayleigh to supershear speeds. In the present study, we use their experimental configuration to investigate conditions leading to the selection of pulse-like vs. crack-like rupture modes in a setting that mimics crustal earthquakes. The geometry, loading , and nucleation mechanism are essentially 2D. This configuration is relevant for understanding the dynamics of large strike-slip earthquakes, which are dominated by in-plane sliding, and constitutes an experimental equivalent of 2D in-plane or Mode II numerical models of dynamic rupture, which are common in earthquake studies (3-12). Numerical simulations in models that involve homogeneous elastic and interface properties and velocity-independent fault strength result in the crack-like mode of earthquake propagation , in which the duration of slip at each point on the fault is comparable to the overall rupture duration (3, 13-16). However, seismic inversions indicate (17) that ruptures on real faults may propagate in the pulse-like mode, in which slip duration at a point is much shorter than the overall rupture duration. Theoretical and numerical studies have shown that the issue of rupture modes may have important implications for fault con-stitutive laws, stress conditions on faults, energy partition and heat generation during earthquakes, scaling laws, and the spa-tiotemporal complexity of slip (5, 8, 12, 17-24). Pulse-like ruptures have been obtained in a number of numerical simulations that include significant weakening of interface friction with sliding velocity (5, 12, 18-22, 24). The simulations imply that fault friction may be characterized by significant velocity weakening , a conclusion further supported by a number of recent rock experiments and theoretical studies that have uncovered strongly velocity-weakening friction at seismic slip velocities (25-28). Other explanations for the occurrence of pulse-like ruptures include interaction of rupture with fault geometry or local heterogeneities (29-33) and normal stress variation due to differences in material properties across the interface (bimate-rial effect) (6-8). Which mechanism dominates in real earthquakes remains an open research question. In our experiments, there are no heterogeneities in interface properties or prestress and no bimaterial effect. Our goal is to determine whether pulse-like ruptures can occur in such a homogeneous configuration and, if so, what controls the selection of rupture modes. The only prior experimental study of different rupture modes under similarly homogeneous conditions was done with strong impact loading and interfaces with no shear prestress (34). However, those loading conditions are quite different from the ones on tectonically loaded faults in the Earth's crust. In the present study, we use an experimental configuration with an interface prestressed both in compression and in shear (1), simulating a tectonically loaded fault, and combine it with experimental diagnostics that let us conclusively determine the mode and speed of rupture propagation (34, 35). By systematically varying loading parameters, we observe pulse-like and crack-like ruptures, and systematic transition between them. Our results are consistent with the theoretical study of Zheng and Rice (21) who considered velocity-weakening interfaces and showed that selection of rupture modes depends on fault prestress and velocity-weakening properties of faults. We also present experimental observations of pulse-like ruptures transitioning to supershear speeds. Experimental Design The Earth's crust was simulated by a square (150 150 mm) photoelastic plate with a thickness of 9.5 mm. The plate was cut into two identical quadrilaterals, introducing an interface inclined at an angle to the horizontal (Fig. 1). Care was taken to polish and then roughen the surfaces of the cut for each sample},

	abstract = {We discuss the effects of rate-dependent friction on the propagation of seismic rupture on active faults. Several physicists using Burridge and Knopoff's box and spring model of faulting have proposed that fault complexity may arise from the spontaneous development of a self-similar stress distribution on the fault plane. If this model proves to be correct, it has important consequences for the origin of the complexity of seismic sources. In order to test these ideas on a more realistic earthquake model, we developed a new boundary integral equation method for studying rupture propagation along an antiplane fault in the presence of nonlinear rate-dependent friction. We study rupture dynamics of models with single and twin asperities. In our models, asperities are places on the fault with a higher value of prestress. Otherwise all fault parameters are homogeneous. We show that for models with such asperities, a slip velocity weakening friction leads to the propagation of supersonic healing phases and to the spontaneous arrest of fracture if the prestress outside the asperities is low enough. For models with asperities, we can also observe narrow slip velocity pulses, qualitatively similar to the so-called Heaton pulses observed in some earthquake aceelerograms. We also observe a complex distribution of stress after the rupture that depends on details of the initial distribution of asperities and on the details of the friction law.},

	abstract = {The TRiC/CCT chaperonin is a 1-MDa hetero-oligomer of 16 subunits that assists the folding of proteins in eukaryotes. Low-resolution structural studies confirmed the TRiC particle to be composed of two stacked octameric rings enclosing a folding cavity. The exact arrangement of the different proteins in the rings underlies the functionality of TRiC and is likely to be conserved across all eukaryotes. Yet despite its importance it has not been determined conclusively, mainly because the different subunits appear nearly identical under low resolution. This work successfully addresses the arrangement problem by the emerging technique of cross-linking, mass spectrometry, and modeling. We cross-linked TRiC under native conditions with a cross-linker that is primarily reactive toward exposed lysine side chains that are spatially close in the context of the particle. Following digestion and mass spectrometry we were able to identify over 60 lysine pairs that underwent cross-linking, thus providing distance restraints between specific residues in the complex. Independently of the cross-link set, we constructed 40,320 (= 8 factorial) computational models of the TRiC particle, which exhaustively enumerate all the possible arrangements of the different subunits. When we assessed the compatibility of each model with the cross-link set, we discovered that one specific model is significantly more compatible than any other model. Furthermore, bootstrapping analysis confirmed that this model is 10 times more likely to result from this cross-link set than the next best-fitting model. Our subunit arrangement is very different than any of the previously reported models and changes the context of existing and future findings on TRiC.},

These oligomeric protein machines, {\textasciitilde}1 megadalton, consist of two back-to-back rings encompassing a central cavity that accommodates polypeptide substrates1, 2, 3. Chaperonin-mediated protein folding is critically dependent on the closure of a built-in lid4, 5, which is triggered by ATP hydrolysis6. The structural rearrangements and molecular events leading to lid closure are still unknown. Here we report four single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Mm-cpn, an archaeal group II chaperonin5, 7, in the nucleotide-free (open) and nucleotide-induced (closed) states. The 4.3 Å resolution of the closed conformation allowed building of the first ever atomic model directly from the single particle cryo-EM density map, in which we were able to visualize the nucleotide and more than 70\% of the side chains. The model of the open conformation was obtained by using the deformable elastic network modelling with the 8 Å resolution open-state cryo-EM density restraints. Together, the open and closed structures show how local conformational changes triggered by ATP hydrolysis lead to an alteration of intersubunit contacts within and across the rings, ultimately causing a rocking motion that closes the ring. Our analyses show that there is an intricate and unforeseen set of interactions controlling allosteric communication and inter-ring signalling, driving the conformational cycle of group II chaperonins. Beyond this, we anticipate that our methodology of combining single particle cryo-EM and computational modelling will become a powerful tool in the determination of atomic details involved in the dynamic processes of macromolecular machines in solution.},

The chaperonin substrate-binding sites are exposed, and the lid is open in both the ATP-free and ATP-bound prehydrolysis states. ATP hydrolysis has a dual function in the folding cycle, triggering both lid closure and substrate release into the central chamber. Notably, substrate release can occur in the absence of a lid, and lid closure can occur without substrate release. However, productive folding requires both events, so that the polypeptide is released into the confined space of the closed chamber where it folds.

Gene duplication has been an important force in the evolution of group II chaperonins: Archaea possess one, two, or three homologous chaperonin subunit-encoding genes, and eight distinct CCT gene families (paralogs) have been described in eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that while the duplications in archaeal chaperonin genes have occurred numerous times independently in a lineage-specific fashion, the eight different CCT subunits found in eukaryotes are the products of duplications that occurred early and very likely only once in the evolution of the eukaryotic nuclear genome. Analyses of CCT sequences from diverse eukaryotic species reveal that each of the CCT subunits possesses a suite of invariant subunit-specific amino acid residues ("signatures"). When mapped onto the crystal structure of the archaeal chaperonin from Thermoplasma acidophilum, these signatures are located in the apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains. Regions that were found to be variable in length and/or amino acid sequence were localized primarily to the exterior of the molecule and, significantly, to the extreme tip of the apical domain (the "helical protrusion"). In light of recent biochemical and electron microscopic data describing specific CCT-substrate interactions, our results have implications for the evolution of subunit-specific functions in CCT. © 2001 Academic Press.},

	abstract = {The non-linear problem of simulating the structural transition between two known forms of a macromolecule still remains a challenge in structural biology. The problem is usually addressed in an approximate way using 'morphing' techniques, which are linear interpolations of either the Cartesian or the internal coordinates between the initial and end states, followed by energy minimization. Here we describe a web tool that implements a new method to calculate the most probable trajectory that is exact for harmonic potentials; as an illustration of the method, the classical Calpha-based Elastic Network Model (ENM) is used both for the initial and the final states but other variants of the ENM are also possible. The Langevin equation under this potential is solved analytically using the Onsager and Machlup action minimization formalism on each side of the transition, thus replacing the original non-linear problem by a pair of linear differential equations joined by a non-linear boundary matching condition. The crossover between the two multidimensional energy curves around each state is found numerically using an iterative approach, producing the most probable trajectory and fully characterizing the transition state and its energy.

The phase power-spectrum level varies by seven orders of magnitude as the sun-earth-spacecraft (elongation) angle changes from 1 to 175 deg. It is noteworthy that a broad minimum in the S-band (2.3 GHz) phase fluctuation occurs in the antisolar direction; the corresponding fractional frequency stability (square root Allan variance) is about 3 x 10 to the -14th for 1000-s integration times. A simultaneous two-frequency two-station observation indicates that the contribution to the phase fluctuation from the ionosphere is significant but dominated by the contribution from the interplanetary medium. Nondispersive tropospheric scintillation was not detected (upper limit to fractional frequency stability about 5 x 10 to the -14th). Evidently, even observations in the antisolar direction will require higher radio frequencies, phase scintillation calibration, and correlation techniques in the data processing, for detection of gravitational bursts at the anticipated strain amplitude levels of no more than 10 to the -15th.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a numerical investigation of the dynamics of pinch-off in liquid drops and jets during injection of a liquid through an orifice into another fluid. The current study is carried out by solving axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations and the interface is captured using a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid approach. The delicate interplay of inertia and viscous effects plays a crucial role in deciding the dynamics of the formation as well as breakup of liquid drops and jets. In the dripping regime, the growth and breakup rate of a drop are studied and quantified by corroborating with theoretical predictions. During the growth stage of the drops, a self-similar behavior of the drop profile is identified over a relatively short duration of time. The viscosity of the drop liquid shows substantial influence on the thinning behavior of a liquid neck and a transition is observed from an inertia dominated regime to an inertia-viscous regime beyond a critical minimum value of the neck radius. The phenomenon of interface overturning is fundamentally related to the magnitude of drop viscosity. The variation of overturning angle as a function of drop viscosity is computed and a critical value of Ohnesorge number is obtained beyond which overturning ceases. Increasing the inertia of drop liquid transforms the system from a periodically dripping regime to a quasiperiodic regime and finally it culminates into an elongated liquid jet. Another interesting transition from dripping to jetting regime is demonstrated by varying the viscosity of the ambient medium. The breakup of jets in Rayleigh mode is explored and the breakup length obtained from our computations shows excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions owing to Rayleigh’s analysis. The ambientmedium is entrained as the jet moves downstream with the creation of a vortical structure just outside the jet signifying increased participation of the ambientmedium in the dynamics of jet breakup at higher inflowrates},

Here, we tested the significance of the hetero-oligomeric nature of CCT in its function by introducing, in each of the eight subunits in turn, an identical mutation at a position that is conserved in all the subunits and is involved in ATP hydrolysis, in order to establish the extent of 'individuality' of the various subunits. Our results show that these identical mutations lead to dramatically different phenotypes. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells with the mutation in subunit CCT2 display heat sensitivity and cold sensitivity for growth, have an excess of actin patches, and are the only strain here generated that is pseudo-diploid. By contrast, cells with the mutation in subunit CCT7 are the only ones to accumulate juxtanuclear protein aggregates that may reflect an impaired stress response in this strain. System-level analysis of the strains using RNA microarrays reveals connections between CCT and several cellular networks, including ribosome biogenesis and TOR2, that help to explain the phenotypic variability observed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Movement is crucial to the biological function of many proteins, yet crystallographic structures of proteins can give us only a static snapshot. The protein dynamics that are important to biological function often happen on a timescale that is unattainable through detailed simulation methods such as molecular dynamics as they often involve crossing high-energy barriers. To address this coarse-grained motion, several methods have been implemented as web servers in which a set of coordinates is usually linearly interpolated from an initial crystallographic structure to a final crystallographic structure. We present a new morphing method that does not extrapolate linearly and can therefore go around high-energy barriers and which can produce different trajectories between the same two starting points. In this work, we evaluate our method and other established coarse-grained methods according to an objective measure: how close a coarse-grained dynamics method comes to a crystallographically determined intermediate structure when calculating a trajectory between the initial and final crystal protein structure. We test this with a set of five proteins with at least three crystallographically determined on-pathway high-resolution intermediate structures from the Protein Data Bank. For simple hinging motions involving a small conformational change, segmentation of the protein into two rigid sections outperforms other more computationally involved methods. However, large-scale conformational change is best addressed using a nonlinear approach and we suggest that there is merit in further developing such methods. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in vivo, TRiC substrate selection is not based solely on intrinsic determinants; instead, specificity is dictated by factors present during protein biogenesis. The identification of cellular substrates revealed that TRiC interacts with folding intermediates of a subset of structurally and functionally diverse polypeptides. Bioinformatics analysis revealed an enrichment in multidomain proteins and regions of beta-strand propensity that are predicted to be slow folding and aggregation prone. Thus, TRiC may have evolved to protect complex protein topologies within its central cavity during biosynthesis and folding.},

The FATCAT approach simultaneously addresses the two major goals of flexible structure alignment; optimizing the alignment and minimizing the number of rigid-body movements (twists) around pivot points (hinges) introduced in the reference protein. In contrast, currently existing flexible structure alignment programs treat the hinge detection as a post-process of a standard rigid body alignment. We illustrate the advantages of the FATCAT approach by several examples of comparison between proteins known to adopt different conformations, where the FATCAT algorithm achieves more accurate structure alignments than current methods, while at the same time introducing fewer hinges.},

	abstract = {We study numerically the effects of fault roughness on the nucleation process during earthquake sequences. The faults are governed by a rate and state friction law. The roughness introduces local barriers that complicate the nucleation process and result in asymmetric expansion of the rupture, non-monotonic increase in the slip rates on the fault, and the generation of multiple slip pulses. These complexities are reflected as irregular fluctuations in the moment rate. There is a large difference between first slip events in the sequences and later events. In the first events, for roughness amplitude í µí± í µí± ≤ 0.002, there is a large increase in the nucleation length with increasing í µí± í µí± . For larger values of í µí± í µí± , slip is mostly aseismic. For the later events there is a trade-off between the effects of the finite fault length and the fault roughness. For í µí± í µí± ≤ 0.002 , the finite length is a more dominant factor and the nucleation length barely changes with í µí± í µí± . For larger values of í µí± í µí± , the roughness plays a larger role and the nucleation length increases significantly with í µí± í µí± . Using an energy balance approach, where the roughness is accounted for in the fault stiffness, we derive an approximate solution for the nucleation length on rough faults. The solution agrees well with the main trends observed in the simulations for the later events and provides an estimate of the frictional and roughness properties under which faults experience a transition between seismic and aseismic slip.},

Appropriate integration path choices serve both to relate the integral to the near tip deformations and, in many cases, to permit its direct evaluation. This averaged measure of the near tip field leads to approximate solutions for several strain-concentration problems. Contained perfectly plastic deformation near a crack tip is analyzed for the plane-strain case with the aid of the slip-line theory. Near tip stresses are shown to be significantly elevated by hydrostatic tension, and a strain singularity results varying inversely with distance from the tip in centered fan regions above and below the tip. Approximate estimates are given for the strain intensity, plastic zone size, and crack tip opening displacement, and the important role of large geometry changes in crack blunting is noted. Another application leads to a general solution for crack tip separations in the Barenblatt-Dugdale crack model. A proof follows on the equivalence of the Griffith energy balance and cohesive force theories of elastic brittle fracture, and hardening behavior is included in a model for plane-stress yielding. A final application leads to approximate estimates of strain concentrations at smooth-ended notch tips in elastic and elastic-plastic materials.},

Each determinant contacts a specific subset of chaperonin subunits, indicating that TRiC paralogs exhibit distinct but overlapping specificities. The substrate binding site in these subunits localizes to a helical region in the apical domains that is structurally equivalent to that of bacterial chaperonins. Transferring the distal portion of helix 11 between TRiC subunits suffices to transfer specificity for a given substrate motif. We conclude that the architecture of the substrate binding domain is evolutionarily conserved among eukaryotic and bacterial chaperonins.

In contrast with group I chaperonins, in which the equatorial domains share a similar conformation between the open and closed states and the largest motions occurs at the intermediate and apical domains, the three domains of the archaeal chaperonin subunit reorient as a single rigid body. The large rotation observed from the open state to the closed state results in a 65\% decrease of the folding chamber volume and creates a highly hydrophilic surface inside the cage.

ATP binding and hydrolysis control opening and closing of the central chaperonin chamber, which transiently provides a protected environment for protein folding. During evolution, two strategies to close the chaperonin chamber have emerged. Archaeal and eukaryotic group II chaperonins contain a built-in lid, whereas bacterial chaperonins use a ring-shaped cofactor as a detachable lid. Here we show that the built-in lid is an allosteric regulator of group II chaperonins, which helps synchronize the subunits within one ring and, to our surprise, also influences inter-ring communication. The lid is dispensable for substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis, but is required for productive substrate folding. These regulatory functions of the lid may serve to allow the symmetrical chaperonins to function as 'two-stroke' motors and may also provide a timer for substrate encapsulation within the closed chamber.},

In the experimental phase of the study, coherent gradient sensing (CGS) has been used to study dynamic fracture in C300 maraging steel. The specimens were subjected to three-point bend impact loading under a drop weight tower. High-speed photographs of the CGS interferograms were analyzed to determine the crack tip location, the velocity and the dynamic fracture toughness as a function of time. Post-mortem examination of the specimens revealed the fractography of the fracture surfaces, including the development of shear lips. In a parallel numerical phase of the study, fracture has been modeled by recourse to an irreversible cohesive law embedded into cohesive elements. These cohesive elements govern all aspects of the separation and closure of the incipient cracks. The cohesive behavior of the material is assumed to be rate independent. The finite element model is three dimensional and consists of quadratic ten-noded tetrahedra. The numerical simulations have proven highly predictive of a number of observed features, including: the crack growth initiation time; the trajectory of the propagating crack tip; and the formation of shear lips near the lateral surfaces. The simulations therefore establish the feasibility of using cohesive models of fracture and cohesive elements to predict dynamic crack-growth initiation and propagation in three dimensions. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Group I chaperonins are generally essential in bacteria, although when multiple copies are found one or more of these are dispensable. Eukaryotes contain eight genes for group II chaperonins, all of which are essential, and it has been shown that these proteins assemble into double-ring complexes with eightfold symmetry where all proteins occupy specific positions in the ring. In archaea, there are one, two or three genes for the group II chaperonins, but whether they are essential for growth is unknown. Here we describe a detailed genetic, structural and biochemical analysis of these proteins in the halophilic archaeon, Haloferax volcanii. This organism contains three genes for group II chaperonins, and we show that all are individually dispensable but at least one must be present for growth. Two of the three possible double mutants can be constructed, but only one of the three genes is capable of fully complementing the stress-dependent phenotypes that these double mutants show. The chaperonin complexes are made up of hetero-oligomers with eightfold symmetry, and the properties of the different combinations of subunits derived from the mutants are distinct. We conclude that, although they are more homologous to eukaryotic than prokaryotic chaperonins, archaeal chaperonins have some redundancy of function.},

	doi = {10.1128/AEM.70.6.3401},
	abstract = {Slip rupture processes on velocity-weakening faults have been found in simulations to occur by two basic modes, the expanding crack and self-healing modes. In the expanding crack mode, as the rupture zone on a fault keeps expanding, slip continues growing everywhere within the rupture. In the self-healing mode, rupture occurs as a slip pulse propagating along the fault, with cessation of slip behind the pulse, so that the slipping region occupies only a small width at the front of the expanding rupture zone. We discuss the determination of rupture mode for dynamic slip between elastic half-spaces that are uniformly prestressed at background loading level tau(0)(b) outside a perturbed zone where rupture is nucleated. The interface follows a rate and state law such that strength tau(strength) approaches a velocity-dependent steady-state value tau(ss)(V) for sustained slip at velocity V, where d tau(ss)(V)/dV less than or equal to 0 (velocity weakening). By proving a theorem on when a certain type of cracklike solution cannot exist, and by analyzing the results of 2D antiplane simulations of rupture propagation for different classes of constitutive laws, and for a wide range of parameters within each, we develop explanations of when one or the other mode of rupture will result. The explanation is given in terms of a critical stress level tau(pulse) and a dimensionless velocity-weakening parameter T that is defined when tau(0)(b) greater than or equal to tau(pulse). Here tau(pulse) is the largest value of tau(0)(b) satisfying tau(0)(b) - (mu/2c)V less than or equal to tau(ss)(V) for all V {\textgreater} 0, where mu is the shear modulus and c is the shear wave speed. Also, T = [- d tau(ss)(V)/dV]/(mu/2c) evaluated at V = V-dyna, which is the largest root of tau(0)(b) - (mu/2c)V = tau(ss)(V); T = 1 at tau(0)(b) = tau(pulse), and T diminishes toward 0 as tau(0)(b) is increased above tau(pulse). We thus show that the rupture mode is of the self-healing pulse type in the low-stress range, when tau(0)(b) {\textless} tau(pulse) or when tau(0)(b) is only slightly greater than tau(pulse), such that T is near unity (e.g., T {\textgreater} 0.6). The amplitude of slip in the pulse diminishes with propagation distance at the lowest stress levels, whereas the amplitude increases for tau(0)(b) above a certain threshold tau(arrest), with tau(arrest) {\textless} tau(pulse) in the cases examined. When tau(0)(b) is sufficiently higher than tau(pulse) that T is near zero (e.g., T {\textless} 0.4 in our 2D antiplane simulations), the rupture mode is that of an enlarging shear crack. Thus rupture under low stress is in the self-healing mode and under high stress in the cracklike mode, where our present work shows how to quantify low and high. The results therefore suggest the possibility that the self-healing mode is common for large natural ruptures because the stresses on faults are simply too low to allow the cracklike mode.},

Creep at points of contact causes increases in friction that are proportional to the logarithm of the time that the population of points of contact exist. For static friction that time is the time of stationary contact. For sliding friction the time of contact is determined by the critical displacement required to change the population of contacts and the slip velocity. An analysis of a one-dimensional spring and slider system shows that experimental observations establishing the transition from stable sliding to stick-slip to be a function of normal stress, stiffness and surface finish are a consequence of time-dependent friction.},

It is well known that frictional interfaces separating two dissimilar materials couple interfacial slip and normal stress variations, a coupling that has major implications on their stability, failure mechanism, and rupture directionality. In contrast, it is traditionally assumed that interfaces separating identical materials do not feature such a coupling because of symmetry considerations. We show, combining theory and experiments, that interfaces that separate bodies made of macroscopically identical materials but lack geometrical reflection symmetry generically feature such a coupling. We discuss two applications of this novel feature. First, we show that it accounts for a distinct, and previously unexplained, experimentally observed weakening effect in frictional cracks. Second, we demonstrate that it can destabilize frictional sliding, which is otherwise stable. The emerging framework is expected to find applications in a broad range of systems.},

	abstract = {I. Residual stress measurements Figure S1(a) demonstrates that, to first order, local values of τ r linearly scale with local measurements of σ. In this work we concentrate on the rate dependence of τ r , which is a second order effect. This rate dependence can be easily obscured, however, by spatial variations, the loading configuration, the alignment of the blocks, small changes in the cleaning protocol and contamination of the frictional interface. To eliminate any of these effects we compare rupture events within a single stick-slip sequence. By a stick-slip sequence we mean that the blocks were aligned, pressed together by external normal stress and subsequently shear stress was quasi-statically increased, generating multiple successive rupture events. We only consider stick-slip sequences where a significant variation of rupture velocities was observed; in the sequences considered, both slow and fast rupture events were nucleated. By this method, the rate dependence of τ r /σ can be studied while any irreproducibility in the loading, alignment and cleaning are eliminated. A large diversity of rupture events can often occur spontaneously [1], or be obtained by external rupture nucleation [2]. Measurements obtained from a single stick-slip sequence are presented in Fig. S1(b). Rate dependence of τ r /σ, for each specific location, is evident, while spatial variations can easily obscure this observation. While we do not understand the origin of the spatial variations of our measurements, we can compare measurements at different locations by normalizing the measured τ r /σ by their mean value for v {\textless} 10 −1 m/s (in the range where τ r /σ is roughly rate independent). By this method various measurement locations are compared (Fig. 3(a) of the main text). Subtracting the mean value for v {\textless} 10 −1 m/s results in similar conclusions. We also emphasize that each set of measurements that included the supershear regime (blue symbols in Fig. 3(a)) also included measurements in the sub-Rayleigh regime (orange symbols in Fig. 3(a)). All measurements at each given location were normalized by the same value and therefore their relative comparison is valid.},

	abstract = {We perform real-time measurements of the net contact area between two blocks of like material at the onset of frictional slip. We show that the process of interface detachment, which immediately precedes the inception of frictional sliding, is governed by three different types of detachment fronts. These crack-like detachment fronts differ by both their propagation velocities and by the amount of net contact surface reduction caused by their passage. The most rapid fronts propagate at intersonic velocities but generate a negligible reduction in contact area across the interface. Sub-Rayleigh fronts are crack-like modes which propagate at velocities up to the Rayleigh wave speed, V R , and give rise to an approximate 10\% reduction in net contact area. The most efficient contact area reduction (∼20\%) is precipitated by the passage of 'slow detachment fronts'. These fronts propagate at 'anomalously' slow velocities, which are over an order of magnitude lower than V R yet orders of magnitude higher than other characteristic velocity scales such as either slip or loading velocities. Slow fronts are generated, in conjunction with intersonic fronts, by the sudden arrest of sub-Ray-leigh fronts. No overall sliding of the interface occurs until either of the slower two fronts traverses the entire interface, and motion at the leading edge of the interface is initiated. Slip at the trailing edge of the interface accompanies the motion of both the slow and sub-Rayleigh fronts. We might expect these modes to be important in both fault nucleation and earthquake dynamics.},

	abstract = {We present an experimental study of the onset of local frictional motion along a long, spatially extended interface that separates two PMMA blocks in dry frictional contact. At applied shear forces significantly below the static friction threshold, rapid precursory detachment fronts are excited, which propagate at near sound speeds along the interface. These fronts initiate from the interface edge and arrest prior to traversing the entire sample length. Along the fronts' path, we perform real-time measurements of the real contact area at every spatial point within the interface. In addition, the motion (slip) of the material adjacent to the interface is simultaneously measured at chosen locations. Upon their arrival at each spatial point along their path, these fronts instantaneously (within 4 ls) reduce the net contact area. Net slip is only initiated after this contact area reduction occurs. Slip is initially rapid and progresses at its initial velocity for a constant (60 ls) duration. Slip dynamics then undergo a sharp transition to velocities an order of magnitude slower, which remain nearly constant until slip arrest. We demonstrate that this scenario can be quantitatively explained by a model of interface weakening caused by instantaneous fracture-induced heating. Sustained rapid slip occurs in this weakened phase. Once the interface cools beneath its glass temperature the sharp transition to slow slip takes place. A similar fracture-induced weakening scenario might be expected in additional classes of materials.},

	abstract = {A procedure has been developed to obtain microscope images of regions of contact between roughened surfaces of transparent materials, while the surfaces are subjected to static loads or undergoing frictional slip. Static loading experiments with quartz, calcite, soda-lime glass and acrylic plastic at normal stresses to 30 MPa yield power law distributions of contact areas from the smallest contacts that can be resolved (3.5 μm2) up to a limiting size that correlates with the grain size of the abrasive grit used to roughen the surfaces. In each material, increasing normal stress results in a roughly linear increase of the real area of contact. Mechanisms of contact area increase are by growth of existing contacts, coalescence of contacts and appearance of new contacts. Mean contacts stresses are consistent with the indentation strength of each material. Contact size distributions are insensitive to normal stress indicating that the increase of contact area is approximately self-similar. The contact images and contact distributions are modeled using simulations of surfaces with random fractal topographies. The contact process for model fractal surfaces is represented by the simple expedient of removing material at regions where surface irregularities overlap. Synthetic contact images created by this approach reproduce observed characteristics of the contacts and demonstrate that the exponent in the power law distributions depends on the scaling exponent used to generate the surface topography.},

	abstract = {[1] Large dynamic stresses near earthquake rupture fronts may induce an inelastic response of the surrounding materials, leading to increased energy absorption that may affect dynamic rupture. We systematically investigate the effects of off-fault plastic energy dissipation in 2-D in-plane dynamic rupture simulations under velocity-and-state-dependent friction with severe weakening at high slip velocity. We find that plasticity does not alter the nature of the transitions between different rupture styles (decaying versus growing, pulse-like versus crack-like, and subshear versus supershear ruptures) but increases their required background stress and nucleation size. We systematically quantify the effect of amplitude and orientation of background shear stresses on the asymptotic properties of self-similar pulse-like ruptures: peak slip rate, rupture speed, healing front speed, slip gradient, and the relative contribution of plastic strain to seismic moment. Peak slip velocity and rupture speed remain bounded. From fracture mechanics arguments, we derive a nonlinear relation between their limiting values, appropriate also for crack-like and supershear ruptures. At low background stress, plasticity turns self-similar pulses into steady state pulses, for which plastic strain contributes significantly to the seismic moment. We find that the closeness to failure of the background stress state is an adequate predictor of rupture speed for relatively slow events. Our proposed relations between state of stress and earthquake source properties in the presence of off-fault plasticity may contribute to the improved interpretation of earthquake observations and to pseudodynamic source modeling for ground motion prediction.},

While regular earthquakes are catastrophic events with rupture velocities governed by elastic wave speed, the processes that underlie slow fault slip phenomena, including recent discoveries of tremor, slow-slip and low-frequency earthquakes, are less understood. Theoretical models and sparse laboratory observations have provided insights, but the physics of slow fault rupture remain enigmatic. Here we report on laboratory observations that illuminate the mechanics of slow-slip phenomena. We show that a spectrum of slow-slip behaviours arises near the threshold between stable and unstable failure, and is governed by frictional dynamics via the interplay of fault frictional properties, effective normal stress and the elastic stiffness of the surrounding material. This generalizable frictional mechanism may act in concert with other hypothesized processes that damp dynamic ruptures, and is consistent with the broad range of geologic environments where slow earthquakes are observed.},

	title = {{PH} {YSICAL} {REVIEW} {LETTERS} {Dynamic} {Model} of {Onset} and {Propagation} of {Fracture}},
	abstract = {A two-dimensional model of steady-state crack propagation, in which the stress acting on the fracture surface includes a dissipative term, exhibits a dissipation-dependent effective threshold for fracture. The crack creeps very slowly at external stresses just above the GriSth threshold, and makes an abrupt transition to propagation at roughly the Rayleigh wave speed at higher stresses. When heating due to dissi-pation is taken into account, the model may exhibit a maximum in the crack propagation speed as a function of applied stress. PACS numbers: 62.20.Mk, 46.30.Nz, 81.40.Np, 91.30.Bi At least two fundamental issues remain unresolved in the modern theory of fracture dynamics [I]. One of these concerns the nature of the Griftith threshold for the onset of crack propagation; a second has to do with propagation speeds and the mechanisms by which they may be limited. In principle, the Gri\%th threshold is the externally applied stress at which the flow of elastic energy to the tip of a crack can do just the minimum work necessary for the creation of new fracture surfaces. Measurements of this threshold, however, often yield fracture energies that are appreciably larger than estimates of bare surface energies. This discrepancy usually is ascribed to the extra work done by dissipative forces; but dissipative effects are intrinsically velocity dependent and therefore should play no role in setting a zero-velocity threshold. A common assumption among experts in fracture mechanics is that, once a crack starts moving in an ideal, defect-free solid, its speed can be limited only by the rate at which stored elastic energy is transported to the crack tip. Thus the limiting speed of a crack must be a sound velocity or, more specifically, the velocity of Rayleigh waves moving along the free fracture surface. Despite its fundamental importance, this assumption has not been tested extensively by experiment. Recent measurements by Fineberg et al [2] indicate th.at, in at least one plastic material, the limiting fracture speed is significantly less than the Rayleigh velocity, and the approach to this limiting speed is accompanied by the onset of a dynamic in-stabilityy. Some insight regarding both of these issues can be obtained from the study of a simple but nontrivial model of steady-crack motion. Consider a two-dimensional elastic material in the (x,y) plane, and suppose that a mode III (antiplane) crack moves along the x axis. The displacement of the material, u(x, y, t), obeys a scalar, massive wave equation of the form u =c'V'u-co'(u-W). Here, c is the wave speed, m is the "mass, " and co h, is an applied force. We include the mass in (1) as a device that allows us to consider a finite applied strain without having to deal explicitly with the outer boundaries of the system. In effect, our material is tied elastically to a sub-strate or, within a reasonable approximation, the crack is moving along the center line of a strip of finite width. The presence of a small but nonzero to in (1) implies the existence of a large length scale, say, W=c/to. For example , 8' might be the width of the strip or the distance between the material and the substrate. By definition, u =0 along the unbroken portion of the x axis. Far from this axis, or well behind the crack tip where the cohesive forces vanish and the stress is fully relaxed , the displacement u relaxes to A. Thus, the externally applied strain at infinity, which is the driving force for crack motion, is e =4/W. To complete the definition of the model, we must specify the traction applied to the fracture surface. The crucial assumption is that this traction can be written in the form p =a"[uj-ti r)u t) u y-0 9x y-0 (2) The quantity p on the left-hand side of (2) is an elastic modulus. On the right-hand side, cr, [uj is the cohesive stress acting between the open crack faces which, for simplicity , we take to be re, 0 (u (6, 0, u)6. where u is the crack-opening displacement u(x, O, t), a{\textasciitilde}, is the yield stress, 6 is the range of the cohesive force, and the nominal fracture energy per unit area of fracture surface 1s (7y6. The second term on the right-hand side of (2) is a viscous damping stress acting on the fracture surface. A viscosity of this form is the simplest way of modeling a general dissipative mechanism that depends upon the motion of the system. The two spatial derivatives preserve reflection and translation symmetries, and the single time derivative breaks time-reversal symmetry to produce energy dissipation. Phenomenologically, there is no reason why such a term should not be present in these 3592},

	title = {Supercooled {Liquids} for {Pedestrians}},
	abstract = {When we lower the temperature of a liquid, at some point we meet a first order phase transition to the crystal. Yet, under certain conditions it is possible to keep the system in its metastable phase and to avoid crystallization. In this way the liquid enters in the supercooled phase. Supercooled liquids have a very rich phenomenology, which is still far from being completely understood. To begin with, there is the problem of how to prevent crystallization and how deeply the liquid can be supercooled before a metastability limit is hit. But by far the most interesting feature of supercooled liquids is the dynamic glass transition: when the temperature is decreased below a certain point, the relaxation time increases so much that a dramatic dynamical arrest intervenes and we are unable to equilibrate the system within reasonable experimental times. The glass transition is a phenomenon whose physical origin has stirred an enormous interest in the last hundred years. Why does it occur? Is it just a conventional reference point, or does it have a more profound physical meaning? Is it a purely dynamical event, or the manifestation of a true thermodynamic transition? What is the correlation length associated to the sharp increase of the relaxation time? Can we define a new kind of amorphous order? A shared theory of supercooled liquids and the glass transition does not yet exist and these questions are still largely open. Here, I will illustrate in the most elementary fashion the main phenomenological traits of supercooled liquids and discuss in a very partial way a few theoretical ideas on the subject. Contents},

	abstract = {Glass formation in nature and materials science is reviewed and the recent recognition of polymorphism within the glassy state, polyamorphism, is discussed. The process by which the glassy state originates during the continuous cooling or viscous slowdown process, is examined and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. The conversion of strong liquids to fragile liquids by pressure-induced coordination number increases is discussed, and then it is shown that for the same type of system it is possible to have the same conversion accomplished via a first-order transition within the liquid state. The systems in which this can happen are of the same type which exhibit polyamorphism, and the whole phenomenology can be accounted for by a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The concept of complex amorphous systems which can lose a significant number of degrees of freedom through weak first-order transitions is then used to discuss the relation between native and denatured hydrated proteins, since the latter have much in common with plasticized chain polymer systems. Finally, we close the circle by taking a short-timescale phenomenon given much attention by protein physicists, v/z., the onset of an anomaly in the Debye-Waller factor with increasing temperature, and showing that for a wide variety of liquids, including computer-simulated strong and fragile ionic liquids, this phenomenon is closely correlated with the experimental glass transition temperature. This implies that the latter owes its origin to the onset of strong anharmonicity in certain components of the vibrational density of states (evidently related to the boson peak) which then permits the system to gain access to its configurational degrees of freedom. The more anharmonic these vibrational components, the closer to the Kauzmann temperature will commence the exploration of configuration space and, for a given configurational microstate degeneracy, the more fragile the liquid will be.},

	abstract = {S U M M A R Y We study in-plane ruptures on a bimaterial fault governed by a velocity-weakening friction with a regularized normal stress response. Numerical simulations and analytical estimates provide characterization of the ranges of velocity-weakening scales, nucleation lengths and background stresses for which ruptures behave as cracks or pulses, decaying or sustained, bilateral or unilateral. With strongly velocity-weakening friction, ruptures occur under a wide range of conditions as large-scale pulses with a preferred propagation direction, that of slip of the more compliant material. Such ruptures have macroscopic asymmetry manifested by significantly larger seismic potency and propagation distance in the preferred direction, and clearly quantified by the directivity ratio derived from the second order moments of the spatio-temporal distribution of slip rate. The macroscopic rupture asymmetry of the large-scale pulses stems from the difference in the criticality conditions for self-sustained propagation in each rupture direction, induced by the asymmetric normal stress changes operating in bimaterial interfaces. In contrast, crack-like ruptures show macroscopic asymmetry under restrictive conditions. The discussed mechanism is robust with respect to regularization parameters, ranges of stress heterogeneities and a proxy for off-fault yielding and should operate similarly for crustal-scale rupture pulses even in the absence of velocity-weakening. Small-scale pulses, driven by the bimaterial normal stress reduction at the scale of the process zone, can detach from the rupture front of the large-scale pulses that propagate in the preferred direction. However, their occurrence depends on the relaxation scale in the regularization of the normal stress response and their development can be hindered by off-fault yielding.},

	abstract = {A theory of friction is presented that may be more applicable to geologic materials than the classic Bowden and Tabor theory. In the model, surfaces touch at the peaks of asperities and sliding occurs when the asperities fail by brittle fracture. The coefficient of friction, μ, was calculated from the strength of asperities of certain ideal shapes; for cone‐shaped asperities, μ is about 0.1 and for wedge‐shaped asperities, μ is about 0.15. For actual situations which seem close to the ideal model, observed μ was found to be very close to 0.1, even for materials such as quartz and calcite with widely differing strengths. If surface forces are present, the theory predicts that μ should decrease with load and that it should be higher in a vacuum than in air. In the presence of a fluid film between sliding surfaces, μ should depend on the area of the surfaces in contact. Both effects are observed. The character of wear particles produced during sliding and the way in which μ depends on normal load, roughness,...},

It is the collapse that subsequently leads to the jet formation. We show that the divergence of the jet velocity can be understood using simple scaling arguments. In addition, we find that very large air bubbles can remain trapped in the drops. The surprising occurrence of the bubbles for low-speed impact is connected with the nature of the singularities, and can have important consequences for drop deposition, e.g., in ink-jet printing.},

In a related development, super-oscillating functions, that is, band-limited functions that locally oscillate faster than their highest Fourier component, were introduced and experimentally applied for super-resolution microscopy. Up till now, only simple Gaussian-like sub-diffraction spots were used. Here we show that the amplitude and phase profile of these sub-diffraction spots can be arbitrarily controlled. In particular, we utilize Hermite-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss and Airy functions to structure super-oscillating beams with sub-diffraction lobes. These structured beams are then used for high-resolution trapping and manipulation of nanometer-sized particles. The trapping potential provides unprecedented localization accuracy and stiffness, significantly exceeding those provided by standard diffraction-limited beams.},

	title = {The nonlinear nature of friction},
	url = {www.nature.com/nature},
	abstract = {Tribology is the study of adhesion, friction, lubrication and wear of surfaces in relative motion. It remains as important today as it was in ancient times, arising in the fields of physics, chemistry, geology, biology and engineering. The more we learn about tribology the more complex it appears. Nevertheless, recent experiments coupled to theoretical modelling have made great advances in unifying apparently diverse phenomena and revealed many subtle and often non-intuitive aspects of matter in motion, which stem from the nonlinear nature of the problem. F riction plays a central role in diverse systems and phenomena that at first sight may seem unrelated, but which on closer scrutiny are found to display common features that are shared by all tribological processes, in technological, geological or biological areas. The development of durable and/or low-friction surfaces and thin lubricating films has become an important factor in the miniaturization of moving components in many technological devices. These include micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), computer recording systems and miniature motors with small loads. The old, simple empirical laws of friction do not always hold in such systems; this is due to their high surface-to-volume ratio and the greater importance of surface chemistry, adhesion and surface structure or roughness. Conventional tribolo-gical and lubrication techniques used for large objects can be ineffective at the nanometre scale, which requires new methods for control. Another rapidly growing area of tribology is in biosystems, and particularly the lubrication mechanisms in joints. Through the process of natural selection, nature has produced water-based lubricant systems that far outclass the best oil-based lubricants of most man-made devices; to emulate these systems is one of today's great challenges. At the conceptual and theoretical levels, however, recent advances have revealed the enormous complexity of even the simplest tribological process. Friction is intimately related to both adhesion and wear, and all three require an understanding of highly non-equilibrium processes occurring at the molecular level to determine what happens at the macroscopic level. Surfaces can be smooth or rough, hard or soft, elastic, viscoelastic or plastic, brittle or ductile, dry (unlubricated) or lubricated, and of very different chemistries. The multitude of asperities on two shearing surfaces are constantly coming into and out of contact, where the local pressure between them can fluctuate between ,1 Pa (10 25 atmospheres of pressure) and GPa (10 4 atmospheres) within microseconds. These are extreme conditions that cannot always be treated by simple 'linear' theories. Modern views of friction To understand the behaviour of two real surfaces in relative motion while still in contact, we need to look into what is going on at the 'single asperity' level. With the advent of the atomic force microscope 1 (AFM) and the surface forces apparatus 2 (SFA) it became possible to study individual sliding junctions at the molecular level. The AFM and SFA are ideal tools in nano-, micro-and macroscopic tribological experiments for measuring the normal and lateral forces, and wear, between (1) a nanometre-radius tip or micro-metre-sized colloidal particle against a substrate surface, and (2) with the SFA, two macroscopic molecularly smooth or rough surfaces of measurable molecular contact area that confine a lubricant film of measurable thickness. Three theoretical approaches that have been introduced to investigate frictional forces in sheared systems are illustrated in Fig. 1: large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations 3-9 , phe-nomenological rate-state (RS) models 10-15 , and 'minimalistic' models (MM) 16-18. Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages , and a different emphasis. A tribological model is expected to recover certain key experimental observations, some of which are shown in the left panels of Fig. 2, as (1) structural transitions in thin lubricating liquid films induced by confining surfaces 19,20 and how these are related to (2) periodic and chaotic stick-slip motion 21-23 (Fig. 2a, b), where the shape of the stick-slip can be sawtooth or oscillatory 24 , (3) transitions between 'smooth' and stick-slip sliding at certain critical sliding velocities or loads 24,25 (Fig. 2c), (4) the very high effective viscosities of confined liquid films 26 , and (5) the funicity, that is, dependence on the previous history, of friction forces 21,27. Atomistic MD simulations (Fig. 1) have a wide range of applicability and have reached a high level of rigour and accuracy. They help us to understand liquid layering in nano-confinement 28 , the relationship between static and kinetic friction 6,10 , the nature of transitions between stick-slip and smooth sliding 4 , slippage at solid-liquid interfaces 4,29,30 , shear thinning 29 and the friction of rough surfaces 9. But MD simulations are currently limited to timescales no greater than tens of nanoseconds and length scales of tens of nanometres, which are too short for analysing many tribological systems 7. An important issue, therefore, was how to reduce the large-scale, many-parameter MD simulations to simpler descriptions with only a few equations of motion. Various phenomenological RS models 10-15 provided such a description (Fig. 1), where the coefficients of one or two dynamical equations are fitted to experiment variables and then used to describe a wide range of observed frictional behaviours, such as the dilation of a liquid under shear 15 and the transition between stick-slip (regular or chaotic) and smooth sliding friction 12,31. However, most 'state variables' in RS models cannot yet be quantitatively related to physical system properties 11,12. An additional understanding of friction came with the MM (Fig. 1) that focuses on a small number of the most relevant degrees of freedom of confined molecules but can nevertheless explain phenomena of high complexity 16-18,32,33. Moreover, the MM enabled predictions to be made that were later verified experimentally 23,25. The MM naturally led to two characteristic states of the embedded system when sheared in the presence of thermal noise: 'trapped' and 'sliding' states. These are the ingredients that lead to stick-slip and the transition to sliding and are therefore the essential requirements for successful modelling of friction 34. The MM emphasized the nonlinear nature of frictional dynamics that has led to a potentially new method for controlling friction and/or boundary slip via the external manipulations. progress NATURE {\textbar} VOL 430 {\textbar} 29 JULY 2004 {\textbar} www.nature.com/nature 525},

	abstract = {Large dynamic stresses near earthquake rupture fronts may induce an in- elastic response of the surrounding materials, leading to increased energy absorption that may affect dynamic rupture. We systematically investigate the effects of off-fault plas- tic energy dissipation in 2D in-plane dynamic ruptures under velocity-and-state-dependent friction with severe weakening at high slip-velocity. We find that plasticity does not al- ter the nature of the transitions between different rupture styles (decaying vs. growing, pulse-like vs. crack-like, and sub-shear vs. super-shear ruptures) but increases their re- quired background stress and nucleation size. We systematically quantify the effect of amplitude and orientation of background shear stresses on the asymptotic properties of self-similar pulse-like ruptures: peak slip rate, rupture speed, healing front speed, slip gradient and the relative contribution of plastic strain to seismic moment. Peak slip ve- locity and rupture speed remain bounded. From fracture mechanics arguments we de- rive a non-linear relation between their limiting values, apropriate also for crack-like and supershear ruptures. At low background stress, plasticity turns self-similar pulses into steady-state pulses, for which plastic strain contributes significantly to the seismic mo- ment. We find that the closeness to failure of the background stress state is an adequate predictor of rupture speed for relatively slow events. Our obtained relations between state of stress and earthquake source properties in the presence of off-fault plasticity may con- tribute to the improved interpretation of earthquake observations and to pseudo-dynamic source modeling for ground motion prediction.},

Recent numerical results on several representative models are reviewed, with attention to both their "critical" and "characteristic" properties. We highlight some of relevant notions and related issues, including the origin of power-laws often observed in statistical properties of earthquakes, apparently contrasting features of characteristic earthquakes or asperities, the nature of precursory phenomena and nucleation processes, the origin of slow earthquakes, etc.},

	abstract = {Glass formation in nature and materials science is reviewed and the recent recognition of polymorphism within the glassy state, polyamorphism, is discussed. The process by which the glassy state originates during the continuous cooling or viscous slowdown process, is examined and the three canonical characteristics of relaxing liquids are correlated through the fragility. The conversion of strong liquids to fragile liquids by pressure-induced coordination number increases is discussed, and then it is shown that for the same type of system it is possible to have the same conversion accomplished via a first-order transition within the liquid state. The systems in which this can happen are of the same type which exhibit polyamorphism, and the whole phenomenology can be accounted for by a recent simple modification of the van der Waals model for tetrahedrally bonded liquids. The concept of complex amorphous systems which can lose a significant number of degrees of freedom through weak first-order transitions is then used to discuss the relation between native and denatured hydrated proteins, since the latter have much in common with plasticized chain polymer systems. Finally, we close the circle by taking a short-timescale phenomenon given much attention by protein physicists, v/z., the onset of an anomaly in the Debye-Waller factor with increasing temperature, and showing that for a wide variety of liquids, including computer-simulated strong and fragile ionic liquids, this phenomenon is closely correlated with the experimental glass transition temperature. This implies that the latter owes its origin to the onset of strong anharmonicity in certain components of the vibrational density of states (evidently related to the boson peak) which then permits the system to gain access to its configurational degrees of freedom. The more anharmonic these vibrational components, the closer to the Kauzmann temperature will commence the exploration of configuration space and, for a given configurational microstate degeneracy, the more fragile the liquid will be.},

	abstract = {The compression yield behaviour of PMMA has been investigated, here, over a wide range of experimental conditions which cannot be reached in tensile tests owing to the brittle nature of the material. The plot of the ratio of the compression yield stress to absolute temperature, as a function of the logarithm of the strain-rate, gives a set of parallel curves which can be accurately superimposed by shifting along a slanting straight line. A master curve is built from which the yield behaviour may be predicted for any state of stress, or value of temperature and strain-rate in the glassy range, using Bauwens' yield criterion. The validity of the procedure is checked for compression tests at low temperatures, for tensile tests in the range of experimental conditions where PMMA yields and for torsional tests under hydrostatic pressure (data of Ward et al). In every case, the fit is found to be quite accurate. A region of experimental conditions is determined where the compression yield behaviour may not be described by the Ree-Eyring treatment involving a hyperbolic sine function. In this region, the Bauwens approach, which consists of a modification of the Ree-Eyring theory, taking into account a distribution of relaxation times and linking the yield behaviour with the/3 mechanical loss peak, is found to give an acceptable fit to the data.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41586-019-0946-4},
	abstract = {Many physical phenomena create colour: spectrally selective light absorption by pigments and dyes 1,2 , material-specific optical dispersion 3 and light interference 4-11 in micrometre-scale and nanometre-scale periodic structures 12-17. In addition, scattering, diffraction and interference mechanisms are inherent to spherical droplets 18 , which contribute to atmospheric phenomena such as glories, coronas and rainbows 19. Here we describe a previously unrecognized mechanism for creating iridescent structural colour with large angular spectral separation. Light travelling along different trajectories of total internal reflection at a concave optical interface can interfere to generate brilliant patterns of colour. The effect is generated at interfaces with dimensions that are orders of magnitude larger than the wavelength of visible light and is readily observed in systems as simple as water drops condensed on a transparent substrate. We also exploit this phenomenon in complex systems, including multiphase droplets, three-dimensional patterned polymer surfaces and solid microparticles, to create patterns of iridescent colour that are consistent with theoretical predictions. Such controllable structural colouration is straightforward to generate at microscale interfaces, so we expect that the design principles and predictive theory outlined here will be of interest both for fundamental exploration in optics and for application in functional colloidal inks and paints, displays and sensors. We observed the structural colouration within monodisperse, biphasic Janus oil droplets containing heptane (refractive index n H ≈ 1.37) and perfluorohexane (n F ≈ 1.27) dispersed in aqueous surfactant (Fig. 1a; see Methods for determination of refractive indices). Upon illumination with collimated white light from above, droplets with an upward-facing concave internal interface between the constituent oils exhibit intense angle-dependent colouration in reflection (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Video 1). Microscopic observations reveal that the reflected light emanates from a ring near the droplets' three-phase contact line (Fig. 1c), suggesting that the colour is due to light-matter interactions within single droplets rather than periodic droplet arrangement. Polydisperse droplets of identical oil volume ratios and contact angles were found to exhibit size-dependent colour (Fig. 1d); the resulting mix of colours gives rise to a glittery white appearance as seen by the unaided eye (Fig. 1e). Droplets polymerized into solid particles retain reflected colour but do not orient with gravity as well as the liquid droplets, highlighting the importance of the orientation of the hydrocarbon-fluorocarbon interface with respect to the light in generating the optical effect (Fig. 1f). Given that the orientation of the droplet-internal interface was essential to the optical mechanism, we wondered whether the colours could be replicated in simpler materials with a similar concave geometry , such as that of a sessile droplet. Upon condensing water onto the underside of a transparent, polystyrene Petri dish lid (advancing contact angle, 70°), we observed substantial colour separation and iridescence (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Video 2). Again, the coloured light emanates from near the solid-liquid contact line and the effect is dependent on sessile-droplet diameter and contact angle (Fig. 1h, i). Solid polymeric hemispheres of dimensions comparable to those of the sessile drop-lets also show similar behaviour (Extended Data Fig. 1) and display varying reflected colour when exposed to media of different refractive index (Supplementary Video 3). As a way of systematically quantifying the light scattering and iridescence of these materials and capturing the entire angular colour distribution, we projected the reflected light onto a translucent hemispherical screen (half of a ping-pong ball). This technique allows us to visualize all of the colours for all viewing angles in a single image (Fig. 2a-c). We observed that the angular separation of the colours is large, approximately 30-35° from red to blue, for the systems described in Fig. 1. This colour separation cannot be explained with known structural colouration mechanisms, which are incompatible with the large length scales and geometries of these interfaces. We were thereby motivated to discover the origin of this iridescence. Given that the colour separation phenomenon is generalizable to microscale concave interfaces with adjacent volumes of high-and low-refractive-index media, and that the light reflects from near the edge of the concave interface, we hypothesized that total internal reflection (TIR) of light along the concave interface has an important role. However, although TIR explains how light is reflected with pronounced intensity, it alone cannot account for the colour variations observed. Material dispersion can also not accurately describe the angular colour separation nor the size dependence in a simple ray-tracing model (Extended Data Fig. 2). Consequently, another optical mechanism must be at play. In general, iridescent structural colours are caused by interference of light waves taking different paths through a material 20. In photonic crystals or gratings, such interference is created through surface or volume periodicity of the order of the wavelength of light, which is not present in our system. Interference of light within spherical water droplets is responsible for the colourful atmospheric effect known as a glory. Typically, optical phenomena caused by scattering spheres, such as glories and rainbows, are modelled using Mie scattering theory 19. However, Mie theory applies only to particles with spherical symmetry, which is not present in the systems we consider 21 ; the sessile droplets and domes are spherical caps and the concave interior interfaces of the biphasic droplets similarly break spherical symmetry. This broken symmetry enables TIR of light along a concave interface, which is not possible in perfect spheres. Hence, we hypothesized that the observed colours result from the interference of this light propagating by TIR on different paths along a concave interface. To test our prediction, we first considered a simplified system in which light would be expected to propagate in a single plane, such as in a cylindrical segment. Provided the incident light direction is perpendicular to the cylinder symmetry axis, the reflected rays are expected to all lie within the plane perpendicular to that axis (Fig. 3a). We used multiphoton lithography to print arrays of cylindrical (Fig. 3b, c) and polygonal segments of varying numbers of sides (Extended Data Fig. 3) and observed reflected iridescent colour for all structures that supported multiple trajectories of TIR.

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.135504},
	abstract = {We investigate the scaling properties of postmortem fracture surfaces in silica glass and glassy ceramics. In both cases, the 2D height-height correlation function is found to obey Family-Viseck scaling properties, but with two sets of critical exponents, in particular, a roughness exponent ' 0:75 in homogeneous glass and ' 0:4 in glassy ceramics. The ranges of length scales over which these two scalings are observed are shown to be below and above the size of the process zone, respectively. A model derived from linear elastic fracture mechanics in the quasistatic approximation succeeds to reproduce the scaling exponents observed in glassy ceramics. The critical exponents observed in homogeneous glass are conjectured to reflect the damage screening occurring for length scales below the size of the process zone. The morphology of fracture surfaces is a signature of the complex damage and fracture processes occurring at the microstructure scale that lead to the failure of a given heterogeneous material. Since the pioneering work of Mandelbrot et al. [1], a large amount of studies have shown that crack surface roughening exhibits some universal scaling features: Fracture surfaces were found to be self-affine over a wide range of length scales, characterized by a universal roughness exponent 0:8, weakly dependent on the nature of the material and on the failure mode (see, e.g., [2] for a review). Very recent studies [3] showed that a complete description of the scaling properties of fracture surfaces calls for the use of the two-dimensional (2D) height-height correlation function. This function was observed to exhibit anisotropic scaling properties similar to the Family-Viseck scaling [4] predicted in interface growth models [5], characterized by three critical exponents independent to some extent of the considered material, the loading condition, and the crack growth velocity. The origin of the scaling properties of fracture surfaces is still debated. Hansen and Schmittbuhl [6] suggested that the universal scaling properties of fracture surfaces are due to the fracture propagation being a damage coalescence process described by a stress-weighted percolation phenomenon in a self-generated quadratic damage gradient. Bouchaud et al. [7] proposed to model the fracture surface as the trace left by a crack front moving through randomly distributed microstructural obstacles-the dynamics of which is described through a phenomenological nonlinear Langevin equation, keeping only the terms allowed by the symmetry of the system. Finally, Ramanathan et al. used linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) to derive a linear nonlocal Langevin equation within both elastostatic [8] and elastodynamic [9] approximation. All these approaches succeed to reproduce scale invariant crack surface roughness in qualitative-but unfortunately not quantitative-agreement with the experimental observations [3]. The universality of the roughness exponent was found to suffer from several exceptions: Metallic surfaces investigated at the nanometer scale were found to exhibit self-affine scaling properties, but with a roughness exponent significantly smaller than 0.8, closer to 0.4-0.5 [10,11]. This was first interpreted as a kinetic effect similar to the one expected for a moving line close to its depinning transition [11]-the small (large) scale roughness exponent 0.5 (0.8) corresponding to effective quenched (ther-mal) noise [12]. The relevance of such an interpretation was later questioned since no small scale ' 0:4-0:5 roughness exponent was observed for the nanoresolved fracture surface of silica glass broken under stress corrosion with crack growth velocity as small as the picometer per second [3]. Furthermore, recent experiments reported similar values ' 0:4-0:5 at large length scales in sandstone [13], artificial rock [14], and glassy ceramics [15]. In this latter case, the roughness exponent was found to be independent of the bead size, the porosity, the transgranu-lar or intergranular nature of the failure mode, and the crack growth velocity. This suggests the existence of a second universality class for failure problems. The series of experiments reported here were designed to uncover the origin of these two distinct universality classes and focus more specifically on the range of length scales over which the scaling properties are observed. Two materials are investigated: homogeneous glass and glassy ceramics made of sintered 100 m glass beads. In both cases, the fracture surfaces are found to exhibit Family-Viseck scaling properties but with two different sets of critical exponents, in particular, ' 0:75 for homogeneous glass and ' 0:4 for glassy ceramics. The range of length scales over which these two scalings are observed are shown to be below and above the size of process zone, respectively. Using LEFM, we show that the crack roughness development can been described as an elastic string with nonlocal interactions creeping in a 2D random medium the spatial coordinate along which the crack glob-PRL 97, 135504 (2006) P H Y S I C A L},

	abstract = {This article presents a review of the application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) to crack-tip corrosion during subcritical crack growth in glass. The two principal experimental techniques used in this type of study are (1) the direct observation of crack motion by scanning the tip of a crack during crack growth and (2) the examination of fracture surfaces once the specimen has been fractured in two. The first technique has been used to demonstrate and quantify water condensation at crack tips during subcritical crack growth and is particularly useful at low crack velocities. The second technique has been used to quantify the crack-tip corrosion process and the shape of the crack tip during crack growth. In this article, we discuss experimental results showing that the environment that develops at the tips of freshly fractured glass surfaces in soda lime glass can corrode the glass surfaces near the crack tip. Soda lime silicate glass contains mobile alkali ions that will exchange with hydronium ions in solution at the crack tip, forming a highly basic solution that is corrosive to glass. Experimental evidence for such corrosion has been obtained by the atomic force microscope, which demonstrates a displacement of the two fracture surfaces near the crack tip that can be as much as 20 nm, depending on how long the crack is held open at the fatigue limit. Despite the corrosion and displacement of the crack surfaces, the crack tip itself appears to remain sharp, suggesting that the fatigue limit in soda lime silicate glass is not due to crack-tip blunting. Most likely, the fatigue limit is a consequence of ion exchange at the crack tip, in which hydronium ions in the crack-tip solution exchange with sodium ions in the glass. As hydronium ions are larger than sodium ions, this exchange process leaves a compressive stress within the fresh fracture surface of the glass that resists crack motion and results in a stress-corrosion fatigue limit, as first proposed by Bunker and Michalske. In agreement with this mechanism, no fatigue limit is observed for silica glass, which also exhibits no ion exchange. As the crack-tip solution in silica glass is only mildly acidic, pH \% 5, corrosion does not occur at crack tips of this glass as supported by the observation that no crack-tip displacements are observed in silica glass by AFM. As the proposed ion exchange mechanism used to explain the stress corrosion limit in glass is at variance with the belief that the fatigue limit in glass is the result of crack-tip blunting, we discuss the possibility of plastic deformation at crack tips in glass and conclude that the available experimental data does not support such a model. At the present time, chemical reaction based crack growth theories are most consistent with the body of crack growth data that is available on glass and are probably the best explanation for the phenomenon.},

The heterogeneous area consists of alternating stripes of weaker and stronger frictional properties, which is equivalent to a lower and higher fracture energy, respectively. By comparing the slip front propagation at interfaces that differ solely by the length scale of the heterogeneous pattern, we illustrate that two different propagation regimes exist. Interfaces with wide stripes present slip fronts with propagation speeds that transition from sub-Rayleigh to inter-sonic. Thinner stripes are, however, characterized by the propagation of sub-Rayleigh slip fronts, which are preceded by slip pulses of negligible slip in the weaker stripes. From a macroscopic point of view, an interface with a smaller heterogeneous pattern appears to be stronger than the equivalent coarser interface even though both have the same average properties. The numerical results as well as a theoretical approach based on fracture-mechanics considerations suggest that the origin of these two distinct propagation mechanisms lies in the interaction between the length scales of the cohesive zone and the heterogeneous configuration. We further show by estimating the relevant length scales that the occurring propagation mechanism is influenced by the friction weakening rate of the interface as well as the shear modulus of the bulk material.},

Various mechanisms, such as thermal pressurization and flash heating, have been proposed to cause this weakening during laboratory experiments, yet the processes that aid fault slip in nature remain unknown. Measurements of seismic radiation during an earthquake can be used to estimate the frictional work associated with fault weakening, known as an event's fracture energy. Here we compile new and existing measurements of fracture energy for earthquakes globally that vary in size from borehole microseismicity to great earthquakes. We observe a distinct transition in how fracture energy scales with event size, which implies that faults weaken differently during small and large earthquakes, and earthquakes are not self-similar. We use an elastodynamic numerical model of earthquake rupture to explore possible mechanisms. We find that thermal pressurization of pore fluid by the rapid shear heating of fault gouge can account for the observed scaling of fracture energy in small and large earthquakes, over seven orders of fault slip magnitude. We conclude that thermal pressurization is a widespread and prominent process for fault weakening.},

A rate- and state-dependent friction law governs motion on the fault; the law includes a characteristic slip distance L for evolution of surface state and slip weakening.

The numerical results show richly complex slip, with a spectrum of event sizes, when solved for a grid with oversized cells. However, in every case for which it has been feasible to do the computations, that spatio-temporally complex slip disappears in favor of simple limit cycles of periodically repeated large earthquakes with reduction of cell size h. Further study wil be necessary to determine whether a similar transition occurs when the elastodynamics of rupture propagation is treated more exactly, rather than in the radiation damping approximation. -from Author},

	abstract = {The onset of frictional motion is mediated by rupture-like slip fronts, which nucleate locally and propagate eventually along the entire interface causing global sliding. The static friction coefficient is a macroscopic measure of the applied force at this particular instant when the frictional interface loses stability. However, experimental studies are known to present important scatter in the measurement of static friction; the origin of which remains unexplained. Here, we study the nucleation of local slip at interfaces with slip-weakening friction of random strength and analyze the resulting variability in the measured global strength. Using numerical simulations that solve the elastodynamic equations, we observe that multiple slip patches nucleate simultaneously, many of which are stable and grow only slowly, but one reaches a critical length and starts propagating dynamically. We show that a theoretical criterion based on a static equilibrium solution predicts quantitatively well the onset of frictional sliding. We develop an efficient Monte-Carlo model by adapting the theoretical criterion and study the variability in global strength distribution caused by the stochastic properties of local frictional strength. The results demonstrate that an increasing spatial correlation length on the interface, representing geometric imperfections and roughness, causes lower global static friction. Conversely, smaller correlation length increases the macroscopic strength while its variability decreases. We further show that randomness in local friction properties is insufficient for the existence of systematic precursory slip events. Random or systematic non-uniformity in the driving force, such as potential energy or stress drop, is required for arrested slip fronts. Our model and observations provide a necessary framework for efficient stochastic analysis of macroscopic frictional strength and establish a fundamental basis for probabilistic design criteria for static friction.},

	abstract = {[1] We consider the nucleation of instability on a slip-weakening fault subjected to a heterogeneous, locally peaked "loading" stress. That stress is assumed not only to gradually increase due to tectonic loading but also to retain its peaked character. The case of a linear stress versus slip law is considered in the framework of two-dimensional quasi-static elasticity for a planar fault. Slip initiates when the peak of the loading stress first reaches the strength level of the fault to start slip weakening. Then the size of the slipping region grows under increased loading stress until finally a critical nucleation length is reached, at which no further quasi-static solution exists for additional increase of the loading. That marks the onset of a dynamically controlled instability. We prove that the nucleation length is independent of the shape of the loading stress distribution. Its universal value is proportional to an elastic modulus and inversely proportional to the slip-weakening rate, and it is given by the solution to an eigenvalue problem. That is the same eigenvalue problem introduced by Campillo, Ionescu, and collaborators for dynamic slip nucleation under spatially uniform prestress on a fault segment of fixed length; the critical length that we derive is the same as in their case. To illustrate the nucleation process, and its universal feature, in specific examples, we consider cases for which the loading stress is peaked symmetrically or nonsymmetrically, and we employ a numerical approach based on a Chebyshev polynomial representation.

Abstract Recently deep learning (DL), as a new data-driven technique compared to conventional approaches, has attracted increasing attention in geophysical community, resulting in many opportunities and challenges. DL was proven to have the potential to predict complex system states accurately and relieve the "curse of dimensionality" in large temporal and spatial geophysical applications. We address the basic concepts, state-of-the-art literature, and future trends by reviewing DL approaches in various geosciences scenarios. Exploration geophysics, earthquakes, and remote sensing are the main focuses. More applications, including Earth structure, water resources, atmospheric science, and space science, are also reviewed. Additionally, the difficulties of applying DL in the geophysical community are discussed. The trends of DL in geophysics in recent years are analyzed. Several promising directions are provided for future research involving DL in geophysics, such as unsupervised learning, transfer learning, multimodal DL, federated learning, uncertainty estimation, and active learning. A coding tutorial and a summary of tips for rapidly exploring DL are presented for beginners and interested readers of geophysics.

	title = {Frozen impacted drop : {From} fragmentation to hierarchical crack patterns},
	abstract = {We investigate experimentally the quenching of a liquid pancake, obtained through the impact of a water drop on a cold solid substrate (0 to −60 • C). We show that, below a certain substrate temperature, fractures appear on the frozen pancake and the crack patterns change from a 2D fragmentation regime to a hierarchical fracture regime as the thermal shock is stronger. The different regimes are discussed and the transition temperatures are estimated through classical fracture scaling arguments. Finally, a phase diagram presents how these regimes can be controlled by the drop impact parameters. When molten glass drips into cold water, the outside cools-and shrinks-faster than the inside, creating pent-up tension in the so-called Prince Rupert's drop, known since before 1625 to have very striking mechanical properties [1, 2]. Indeed, while the drop's head stays impervious to even the strongest blows, flick the tail and the whole drop shatters in a myriad of small pieces, in less than a millisecond. In the same way, fragmentation is in fact present in many physical processes, from jet atomi-zation to bubble bursting in fluids [3-5], from spaghetti breaking [6] to popping balloons [7] or broken windows in solids [8, 9]. It is related to diverse applications such as comminution [10], shell case bursting [11], ash generation during eruption [12, 13] or meteoric cratering [14] for instance. Fragmentation is thus a sudden process, where the considered domain mainly divides in one go, with a very fast cracks front propagation. At least as ubiquitous, there exists a complete different crack morphology where space-dividing pattern shows a strong hierarchy of slower fractures [15]. Fractures develop successively, and each new fracture joins older fractures at a typical angle close to ninety degrees [16, 17]. Such patterns are usually observed when the shrinking of a material layer is frustrated by its deposition on a non shrinking substrate, such as drying-induced cracks in mud [18, 19], coffee [20], col-loidal silicas [21], industrial coating [22] or artistic painting [23]. In this paper, we investigate experimentally the quenching of a liquid pancake that is obtained through the impact of a water drop on a very cold solid substrate. We show for the first time that, as a function of the sub-strate temperature, the crack patterns produced by the thermal shock, change from a 2D fragmentation regime to a hierarchical fracture regime, and the transition temperatures are estimated and discussed. The experimental setup consists in dropping a drop of water, with a diameter D 0 = 3.9 mm, on a steel substrate, so as to form a liquid pancake of radius R and typical thickness h 0 (see Fig. 1). Under this simplified geometry h 0 can be estimated by balancing the volume of the drop with that of the cylindrical pancake h 0 = D 3 0 /6R 2. The impact velocity is close to the free fall one : U 0 ∼ √ gH where H is the falling height. Throughout most of the paper, falling height will be kept constant at H = 36 cm. Subsequent pancake radius is : R 8 mm, from which pancake thickness can be deduced : h 0 150µm. The temperature of the substrate T s is typically varied from the water freezing temperature , 0 • C, to −60 • C. It is reached by plunging a large cube of stainless steel (10 3 cm 3) into a liquid nitrogen bath until the desired temperature is reached. The whole experiment is made into a controlled atmosphere box in order to avoid frost formation on the substrate. Because of the small experiment time (max. ∼ 1 s), we can consider that the substrate remains at constant temperature during the dynamics. The drop dynamics is visualized using a high-speed camera recording the spreading from the top. h(t) z T(z) h 0 T s T 0 = 0°C 2R T s 0 ∆T T(z) Figure 1.

Abstract Recently deep learning (DL), as a new data-driven technique compared to conventional approaches, has attracted increasing attention in geophysical community, resulting in many opportunities and challenges. DL was proven to have the potential to predict complex system states accurately and relieve the "curse of dimensionality" in large temporal and spatial geophysical applications. We address the basic concepts, state-of-the-art literature, and future trends by reviewing DL approaches in various geosciences scenarios. Exploration geophysics, earthquakes, and remote sensing are the main focuses. More applications, including Earth structure, water resources, atmospheric science, and space science, are also reviewed. Additionally, the difficulties of applying DL in the geophysical community are discussed. The trends of DL in geophysics in recent years are analyzed. Several promising directions are provided for future research involving DL in geophysics, such as unsupervised learning, transfer learning, multimodal DL, federated learning, uncertainty estimation, and active learning. A coding tutorial and a summary of tips for rapidly exploring DL are presented for beginners and interested readers of geophysics. Plain Language Summary With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), students and researchers in the geophysical community would like to know what AI can bring to geophysical discoveries. We present a review of deep learning, a popular AI technique, for geophysical readers to understand recent advances, open problems, and future trends.

Here we show that by listening to the acoustic signal emitted by a laboratory fault, machine learning can predict the time remaining before it fails with great accuracy. These predictions are based solely on the instantaneous physical characteristics of the acoustical signal and do not make use of its history. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal emitted from the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables failure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We infer that this signal originates from continuous grain motions of the fault gouge as the fault blocks displace. We posit that applying this approach to continuous seismic data may lead to significant advances in identifying currently unknown signals, in providing new insights into fault physics, and in placing bounds on fault failure times.},

We show that the common procedure of estimating the next earthquake size from slip-deficit is unreliable. On the contrary, machine learning predicts well the timing and size of laboratory earthquakes by reconstructing and properly interpreting the spatiotemporally complex loading history of the system.

	abstract = {The behavior of individual stick-slip events observed in three different laboratory experimental configurations is better explained by a "memoryless" earthquake model with fixed inter-event time or fixed slip than it is by the time-and slip-predictable models for earthquake occurrence. We make similar findings in the companion manuscript for the behavior of natural repeating earthquakes. Taken together, these results allow us to conclude that the predictions of a characteristic earthquake model that assumes either fixed slip or fixed recurrence interval should be preferred to the predictions of the time-and slip-predictable models for all earthquakes. Given that the fixed slip and recurrence models are the preferred models for all of the experiments we examine, we infer that in an event-to-event sense the elastic rebound model underlying the time-and slip-predictable models does not explain earthquake behavior. This does not indicate that the elastic rebound model should be rejected in a long-term-sense, but it should be rejected for short-term predictions. The time-and slip-predictable models likely offer worse predictions of earthquake behavior because they rely on assumptions that are too simple to explain the behavior of earthquakes. Specifically, the time-predictable model assumes a constant failure threshold and the slip-predictable model assumes that there is a constant minimum stress. There is experimental and field evidence that these assumptions are not valid for all earthquakes. Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	volume = {54},
	doi = {10.1109/TSP.2006.881199},
	abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of signals. Using an overcomplete dictionary that contains prototype signal-atoms, signals are described by sparse linear combinations of these atoms. Applications that use sparse representation are many and include compression, regularization in inverse problems, feature extraction, and more. Recent activity in this field has concentrated mainly on the study of pursuit algorithms that decompose signals with respect to a given dictionary. Designing dictionaries to better fit the above model can be done by either selecting one from a prespecified set of linear transforms or adapting the dictionary to a set of training signals. Both of these techniques have been considered, but this topic is largely still open. In this paper we propose a novel algorithm for adapting dictionaries in order to achieve sparse signal representations. Given a set of training signals, we seek the dictionary that leads to the best representation for each member in this set, under strict sparsity constraints. We present a new method - the K-SVD algorithm - generalizing the K-means clustering process. K-SVD is an iterative method that alternates between sparse coding of the examples based on the current dictionary and a process of updating the dictionary atoms to better fit the data. The update of the dictionary columns is combined with an update of the sparse representations, thereby accelerating convergence. The K-SVD algorithm is flexible and can work with any pursuit method (e.g., basis pursuit, FOCUSS, or matching pursuit). We analyze this algorithm and demonstrate its results both on synthetic tests and in applications on real image data. © 2006 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Representation of a signal in a sparse way is a useful and popular methodology in signal-processing applications. Among several widely used sparse transforms, dictionary learning (DL) algorithms achieve most attention due to their ability in making data-driven nonanalytical (nonfixed) atoms. Various DL methods are well-established in seismic data processing due to the inherent low-rank property of this kind of data. We have introduced a novel data-driven 3D DL algorithm that is extended from the 2D nonnegative DL scheme via the multitasking strategy for random noise attenuation of seismic data. In addition to providing parts-based learning, we exploit nonnegativity constraint to induce sparsity on the data transformation and reduce the space of the solution and, consequently, the computational cost. In 3D data, we consider each slice as a task. Whereas 3D seismic data exhibit high correlation between slices, a multitask learning approach is used to enhance the performance of the method by sharing a common sparse coefficient matrix for the whole related tasks of the data. Basically, in the learning process, each task can help other tasks to learn better and thus a sparser representation is obtained. Furthermore, different from other DL methods that use a limited random number of patches to learn a dictionary, the proposed algorithm can take the whole data information into account with a reasonable time cost and thus can obtain an efficient and effective denoising performance. We have applied the method on synthetic and real 3D data, which demonstrated superior performance in random noise attenuation when compared with state-of-the-art denoising methods such as MSSA, BM4D, and FXY predictive filtering, especially in amplitude and continuity preservation in low signal-to-noise ratio cases and fault zones.},

	abstract = {In earthquake early warning (EEW), every sufficiently impulsive signal is potentially the first evidence for an unfolding large earthquake. More often than not, however, impulsive signals are mere nuisance signals. One of the most fundamental—and difficult—tasks in EEW is to rapidly and reliably discriminate real local earthquake signals from all other signals. This discrimination is necessarily based on very little information, typically a few seconds worth of seismic waveforms from a small number of stations. As a result, current EEW systems struggle to avoid discrimination errors and suffer from false and missed alerts. In this study we show how modern machine learning classifiers can strongly improve real-time signal/noise discrimination. We develop and compare a series of nonlinear classifiers with variable architecture depths, including fully connected, convolutional and recurrent neural networks, and a model that combines a generative adversarial network with a random forest. We train all classifiers on the same data set, which includes 374 k local earthquake records (M3.0–9.1) and 946 k impulsive noise signals. We find that all classifiers outperform existing simple linear classifiers and that complex models trained directly on the raw signals yield the greatest degree of improvement. Using 3-s-long waveform snippets, the convolutional neural network and the generative adversarial network with a random forest classifiers both reach 99.5\% precision and 99.3\% recall on an independent validation data set. Most misclassifications stem from impulsive teleseismic records, and from incorrectly labeled records in the data set. Our results suggest that machine learning classifiers can strongly improve the reliability and speed of EEW alerts.},

	abstract = {Tectonic faults slip in various manners, which range from ordinary earthquakes to slow slip events to aseismic fault creep. Slow slip and associated tremor are common to many subduction zones, and occur down-dip from the neighbouring locked zone where megaquakes take place. In the clearest cases, such as Cascadia, identified tremor occurs in discrete bursts, primarily during the slow slip event. Here we show that the Cascadia subduction zone is apparently continuously broadcasting a low-amplitude, tremor-like signal that precisely informs of the fault displacement rate throughout the slow slip cycle. Using a method based on machine learning previously developed in the laboratory, we analysed large amounts of raw seismic data from Vancouver Island to separate this signal from the background seismic noise. We posit that this provides indirect real-time access to fault physics on the down-dip portion of the megathrust, and thus may prove useful in determining if and how a slow slip may couple to or evolve into a major earthquake. Continuous seismic signal, filtered out by machine-learning methods, could help infer fault displacement in the Cascadia subduction zone.},

Here we show that by listening to the acoustic signal emitted by a laboratory fault, machine learning can predict the time remaining before it fails with great accuracy. These predictions are based solely on the instantaneous physical characteristics of the acoustical signal and do not make use of its history. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal emitted from the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables failure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We infer that this signal originates from continuous grain motions of the fault gouge as the fault blocks displace. We posit that applying this approach to continuous seismic data may lead to significant advances in identifying currently unknown signals, in providing new insights into fault physics, and in placing bounds on fault failure times.},

Could we make advances by crowdsourcing, drawing from the vast knowledge and creativity of the machine learning (ML) community? We used Google’s ML competition platform, Kaggle, to engage the worldwide ML community with a competition to develop and improve data analysis approaches on a forecasting problem that uses laboratory earthquake data. The competitors were tasked with predicting the time remaining before the next earthquake of successive laboratory quake events, based on only a small portion of the laboratory seismic data. The more than 4,500 participating teams created and shared more than 400 computer programs in openly accessible notebooks. Complementing the now well-known features of seismic data that map to fault criticality in the laboratory, the winning teams employed unexpected strategies based on rescaling failure times as a fraction of the seismic cycle and comparing input distribution of training and testing data. In addition to yielding scientific insights into fault processes in the laboratory and their relation with the evolution of the statistical properties of the associated seismic data, the competition serves as a pedagogical tool for teaching ML in geophysics. The approach may provide a model for other competitions in geosciences or other domains of study to help engage the ML community on problems of significance.

We show that the common procedure of estimating the next earthquake size from slip-deficit is unreliable. On the contrary, machine learning predicts well the timing and size of laboratory earthquakes by reconstructing and properly interpreting the spatiotemporally complex loading history of the system.

	abstract = {An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes and Earth Structures is an introduction to seismology and its role in the earth sciences, and is written for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.The fundamentals of seismic wave propagation are developed using a physical approach and then applied to show how refraction, reflection, and teleseismic techniques are used to study the structure and thus the composition and evolution of the earth. The book shows how seismic waves are used to study earthquakes and are integrated with other data to investigate the plate tectonic processes that cause earthquakes. Figures, examples, problems, and computer exercises teach students about seismology in a creative and intuitive manner. Necessary mathematical tools including vector and tensor analysis, matrix algebra, Fourier analysis, statistics of errors, signal processing, and data inversion are introduced with many relevant examples. The text also addresses the fundamentals of seismometry and applications of seismology to societal issues. Special attention is paid to help students visualize connections between different topics and view seismology as an integrated science. An Introduction to Seismology, Earthquakes, and Earth Structure gives an excellent overview for students of geophysics and tectonics, and provides a strong foundation for further studies in seismology.Multidisciplinary examples throughout the text - catering to students in varied disciplines (geology, mineralogy, petrology, physics, etc.). Most up to date book on the market - includes recent seismic events such as the 1999 Earthquakes in Turkey, Greece, and Taiwan).

We found that fractures nucleate at the onset of the olivine-to-spinel transition. These fractures propagate dynamically (at a nonnegligible fraction of the shear wave velocity) so that intense acoustic emissions are generated. Similar to deep-focus earthquakes, these acoustic emissions arise from pure shear sources and obey the Gutenberg-Richter law without following Omori's law. Microstructural observations prove that dynamic weakening likely involves superplasticity of the nanocrystalline spinel reaction product at seismic strain rates.},

The second technique computes a class saliency map, specific to a given image and class. We show that such maps can be employed for weakly supervised object segmentation using classification ConvNets.

Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-time domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-based regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-dimensional problems.},

This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D CNN instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D CNNs can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep CNNs, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the »Big Data» scale in order to prevent the well-known »overfitting» problem. 1D CNNs can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D CNNs that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal processing applications of compact 1D CNNs with a brief theoretical background.

	abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

	abstract = {Two architectures that generalize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the processing of signals supported on graphs are introduced. We start with the selection graph neural network (GNN), which replaces linear time invariant filters with linear shift invariant graph filters to generate convolutional features and reinterprets pooling as a possibly nonlinear subsampling stage where nearby nodes pool their information in a set of preselected sample nodes. A key component of the architecture is to remember the position of sampled nodes to permit computation of convolutional features at deeper layers. The second architecture, dubbed aggregation GNN, diffuses the signal through the graph and stores the sequence of diffused components observed by a designated node. This procedure effectively aggregates all components into a stream of information having temporal structure to which the convolution and pooling stages of regular CNNs can be applied. A multinode version of aggregation GNNs is further introduced for operation in large-scale graphs. An important property of selection and aggregation GNNs is that they reduce to conventional CNNs when particularized to time signals reinterpreted as graph signals in a circulant graph. Comparative numerical analyses are performed in a source localization application over synthetic and real-world networks. Performance is also evaluated for an authorship attribution problem and text category classification. Multinode aggregation GNNs are consistently the best-performing GNN architecture.},

	abstract = {Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propa- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a compre- hensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or ma- chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not es- sential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

	abstract = {Seismology is experiencing rapid growth in the quantity of data, which has outpaced the development of processing algorithms. Earthquake detection-identification of seismic events in continuous data-is a fundamental operation for observational seismology. We developed an efficient method to detect earthquakes using waveform similarity that overcomes the disadvantages of existing detection methods. Our method, called Fingerprint And Similarity Thresholding (FAST), can analyze a week of continuous seismic waveform data in less than 2 hours, or 140 times faster than autocorrelation. FAST adapts a data mining algorithm, originally designed to identify similar audio clips within large databases; it first creates compact "fingerprints" of waveforms by extracting key discriminative features, then groups similar fingerprints together within a database to facilitate fast, scalable search for similar fingerprint pairs, and finally generates a list of earthquake detections. FAST detected most (21 of 24) cataloged earthquakes and 68 uncataloged earthquakes in 1 week of continuous data from a station located near the Calaveras Fault in central California, achieving detection performance comparable to that of autocorrelation, with some additional false detections. FAST is expected to realize its full potential when applied to extremely long duration data sets over a distributed network of seismic stations. The widespread application of FAST has the potential to aid in the discovery of unexpected seismic signals, improve seismic monitoring, and promote a greater understanding of a variety of earthquake processes.},

	abstract = {As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called "PhaseNet" that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.},

	abstract = {Automatic event detection from time series signals has broad applications. Traditional detection methods detect events primarily by the use of similarity and correlation in data. Those methods can be inefficient and yield low accuracy. In recent years, machine learning techniques have revolutionized many sciences and engineering domains. In particular, the performance of object detection in a 2-D image data has significantly improved due to deep neural networks. In this paper, we develop a deep-learning-based detection method, called 'DeepDetect,' to detect events from seismic signals. We find that the direct adaptation of similar ideas from 2-D object detection to our problem faces two challenges. The first challenge is that the duration of earthquake event varies significantly; the other is that the proposals generated are temporally correlated. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded region-based convolutional neural network to capture earthquake events in different sizes while incorporating contextual information to enrich features for each proposal. To achieve a better generalization performance, we use densely connected blocks as the backbone of our network. Because some positive events are not correctly annotated, we further formulate the detection problem as a learning-from-noise problem. To verify the performance, we employ the seismic data generated from the Pennsylvania State University Rock and Sediment Mechanics Laboratory, and we acquire labels with the help of experts. We show that our techniques yield high accuracy. Therefore, our novel deep-learning-based detection methods can potentially be powerful tools for identifying events from the time series data in various applications.},

A good detection algorithm should be sensitive to small and weak events with a variety of waveform shapes, robust to background noise and non-earthquake signals, and efficient for processing large data volumes. Here, we introduce the Cnn-Rnn Earthquake Detector (CRED), a detector based on deep neural networks. CRED uses a combination of convolutional layers and bi-directional long-short-term memory units in a residual structure. It learns the time-frequency characteristics of the dominant phases in an earthquake signal from three component data recorded on individual stations. We train the network using 500,000 seismograms (250k associated with tectonic earthquakes and 250k identified as noise) recorded in Northern California. The robustness of the trained model with respect to the noise level and non-earthquake signals is shown by applying it to a set of semi-synthetic signals. We also apply the model to one month of continuous data recorded at Central Arkansas to demonstrate its efficiency, generalization, and sensitivity. Our model is able to detect more than 800 microearthquakes as small as −1.3 ML induced during hydraulic fracturing far away than the training region. We compare the performance of the model with the STA/LTA, template matching, and FAST algorithms. Our results indicate an efficient and reliable performance of CRED.

By training a convolutional neural network to detect known tremor on a single seismic station in Cascadia, we isolate and identify tremor and slip preceding and following known larger slow events. The deep neural network can be used for the detection of quasi-continuous tremor, providing a proxy that quantifies the slow slip rate. Furthermore, the model trained in Cascadia recognizes tremor in other subduction zones and also along the San Andreas Fault at Parkfield, suggesting a universality of waveform characteristics and source processes, as posited from experiments and theory.},

	abstract = {Fractures form the main pathways for flow in the subsurface within low-permeability rock. For this reason, accurately predicting flow and transport in fractured systems is vital for improving the performance of subsurface applications. Fracture sizes in these systems can range from millimeters to kilometers. Although modeling flow and transport using the discrete fracture network (DFN) approach is known to be more accurate due to incorporation of the detailed fracture network structure over continuum-based methods, capturing the flow and transport in such a wide range of scales is still computationally intractable. Furthermore, if one has to quantify uncertainty, hundreds of realizations of these DFN models have to be run. To reduce the computational burden, we solve flow and transport on a graph representation of a DFN. We study the accuracy of the graph approach by comparing breakthrough times and tracer particle statistical data between the graph-based and the high-fidelity DFN approaches, for fracture networks with varying number of fractures and degree of heterogeneity. Due to our recent developments in capabilities to perform DFN high-fidelity simulations on fracture networks with large number of fractures, we are in a unique position to perform such a comparison. We show that the graph approach shows a consistent bias with up to an order of magnitude slower breakthrough when compared to the DFN approach. We show that this is due to graph algorithm's underprediction of the pressure gradients across intersections on a given fracture, leading to slower tracer particle speeds between intersections and longer travel times. We present a bias correction methodology to the graph algorithm that reduces the discrepancy between the DFN and graph predictions. We show that with this bias correction, the graph algorithm predictions significantly improve and the results are very accurate. The good accuracy and the low computational cost, with O(10 4) times lower times than the DFN, makes the graph algorithm an ideal technique to incorporate in uncertainty quantification methods.},

In recent years, the intersection of exponentially increasing amounts of data and cheap computing power, from graphics cards in particular, has led to an increasing adoption of machine learning and deep learning techniques, in geoscience in general, and fault physics in particular. This work reviews recent advances in the application of machine learning in the study of fault rupture, ranging from the laboratory to the Earth. Throughout the review, we explore the use of machine learning for fault physics against the backdrop of the discrepancies between laboratory and field observations. We first address some basic principles and concepts behind machine learning (ML), and domain relevant considerations for the application of ML to geophysical data. The review covers ML applied to data from laboratory experiments, which provide controlled, relatively noise-free data for the application of ML algorithms. The review subsequently covers applications of ML to geophysical data in solid Earth, with an emphasis on seismology, that has a long history of data-driven approaches. We also touch briefly on uses of ML in geodesy. Finally, this work provides an overview of the uses of ML in specific applications such as early warning systems, the study of induced seismicity and earthquake forecasting. In addition to trying to explain the technical innovations behind successful applications of machine learning in fault physics, we also analyze and discuss shortcomings of machine learning in general and in this specific context.},

The traditional seismic full-waveform inversion problems are usually posed as nonlinear optimization problems. Solving full-waveform inversion can be computationally challenging for two major reasons. One is the expensive computational cost and the other is the issue of local minima. In this work, we develop an end-to-end data-driven inversion technique, called “InversionNet”, to learn a regression relationship from seismic waveform datasets to subsurface models. Specifically, we build a novel deep convolutional neural network with an encoder-decoder structure, where the encoder learns an abstract representation of the seismic data, which is then used by the decoder to produce a subsurface model. We further incorporate atrous convolutions in our network structure to account for contextural information from the subsurface model. We evaluate the performance of our InversionNet with synthetic seismic waveform data. The experiment results demonstrate that our InversionNet not only yields accurate inversion results but also produces almost real-time inversion.},

	volume = {512},
	doi = {10.1038/NATURE13681},
	abstract = {On 1 April 2014, Northern Chile was struck by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake following a protracted series of foreshocks. The Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile monitored the entire sequence of events, providing unprecedented resolution of the build-up to the main event and its rupture evolution. Here we show that the Iquique earthquake broke a central fraction of the so-called northern Chile seismic gap, the last major segment of the South American plate boundary that had not ruptured in the past century1,2. Since July 2013 three seismic clusters, each lasting a few weeks, hit this part of the plate boundary with earthquakes of increasing peak magnitudes. Starting with the second cluster, geodetic observations show surface displacements that can be associated with slip on the plate interface. These seismic clusters and their slip transients occupied a part of the plate interface that was transitional between a fully locked and a creeping portion. Leading up to this earthquake, the b value of the foreshocks gradually decreased during the years before the earthquake, reversing its trend a few days before the Iquique earthquake. The mainshock finally nucleated at the northern end of the foreshock area, which skirted a locked patch, and ruptured mainly downdip towards higher locking.

	abstract = {On 1 April 2014, Northern Chile was struck by a magnitude 8.1 earthquake following a protracted series of foreshocks. The Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile monitored the entire sequence of events, providing unprecedented resolution of the build-up to the main event and its rupture evolution. Here we show that the Iquique earthquake broke a central fraction of the so-called northern Chile seismic gap, the last major segment of the South American plate boundary that had not ruptured in the past century1,2. Since July 2013 three seismic clusters, each lasting a few weeks, hit this part of the plate boundary with earthquakes of increasing peak magnitudes. Starting with the second cluster, geodetic observations show surface displacements that can be associated with slip on the plate interface. These seismic clusters and their slip transients occupied a part of the plate interface that was transitional between a fully locked and a creeping portion. Leading up to this earthquake, the b value of the foreshocks gradually decreased during the years before the earthquake, reversing its trend a few days before the Iquique earthquake. The mainshock finally nucleated at the northern end of the foreshock area, which skirted a locked patch, and ruptured mainly downdip towards higher locking. Peak slip was attained immediately downdip of the foreshock region and at the margin of the locked patch. We conclude that gradual weakening of the central part of the seismic gap accentuated by the foreshock activity in a zone of intermediate seismic coupling was instrumental in causing final failure, distinguishing the Iquique earthquake from most great earthquakes.

After removing reference frame noise, we model time series as linear trends plus constant acceleration, correcting for coseismic and postseismic effects from the numerous Mw ∼ 6.5+ earthquakes during this period. We find spatially coherent and statistically significant accelerations throughout northern Honshu. Large areas of Japan outside the Tohoku region show insignificant accelerations, demonstrating that the observation is not due to network-wide artifacts. While the accelerations in northern Tohoku (Sanriku area) can be explained by decaying postseismic deformation from pre-1996 earthquakes, the accelerations in south-central Tohoku appear unrelated to postseismic effects. The latter accelerations are associated with a decrease in average trench-normal strain rate and can be explained by increasing slip rate on the Japan trench plate interface and/or updip migration of deep aseismic slip in the decades before the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake.

This article discusses several classes of stochastic models for the origin times and magnitudes of earthquakes. The models are compared for a Japanese data set for the years 1885-1980 using likelihood methods. For the best model, a change of time scale is made to investigate the deviation of the data from the model. Conventional graphical methods associated with stationary Poisson processes can be used with the transformed time scale. For point processes, effective use of such residual analysis makes it possible to find features of the data set that are not captured in the model. Based on such analyses, the utility of seismic quiescence for the prediction of a major earthquake is investigated.},

	abstract = {Attention mechanisms play a central role in NLP systems, especially within
recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Recently, there has been increasing
interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these
modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and
consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A
recent paper claims that `Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace,
2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that
such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it
needs to take into account all elements of the model, using a rigorous
experimental design. We propose four alternative tests to determine
when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights
baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a
diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an
end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful
interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when
reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the
simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness
of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

	abstract = {Attention mechanisms have seen wide adoption in neural NLP models. In
addition to improving predictive performance, these are often touted as
affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution
over attended-to input units, and this is often presented (at least implicitly)
as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what
relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work,
we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to
assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations'
for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned
attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of
feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions
that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard
attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be
treated as though they do. Code for all experiments is available at

	abstract = {Crustal deformation patterns are affected by multiscale granulation and healing processes associated with phase transitions between continuum and discrete states of rocks. The ongoing continuum-discrete transitions are accompanied by progressive evolution of disordered fault networks to dominant localized fault zones, development of bimaterial interfaces, and increasing dynamic weakening of fault surfaces. Results on individual fault zones point to three general dynamic regimes. The first is associated with broad range of heterogeneities, little dynamic weakening, power law frequency-size statistics, temporal clustering of intermediate and large events, and accelerated seismic release before large earthquakes. The second is associated with relatively uniform localized structures, significant dynamic weakening, characteristic earthquake statistics, and quasi-periodic temporal occurrence of large events without precursory accelerated release. For a range of conditions, the fault zone response can switch back and forth between the foregoing two dynamic regimes. Higher temperature, fluid content, and thickness of sedimentary cover reduce the seismic coupling in a region and change the properties of local earthquake sequences. Brittle regions with high seismic coupling have few foreshocks and long-duration aftershock sequences with high event productivity, whereas more viscous regions with low seismic coupling have increased foreshocks activity and low-productivity aftershock seqvences or swarms. The results provide criteria for organizing data in classes associated with different evolutionary stages and different regional conditions. An ability to recognize the dynamic regime of a given fault zone or a region can increase the information content of the data and lead to improved strategies for seismic hazard assessment.

	abstract = {Earthquakes start under conditions that are largely unknown. In laboratory analogue experiments and continuum models, earthquakes transition from slow-slipping, growing nucleation to fast-slipping rupture. In nature, earthquakes generally start abruptly, with no evidence for a nucleation process. Here we report evidence from a strike-slip fault zone in central Alaska of extended earthquake nucleation and of very-low-frequency earthquakes (VLFEs), a phenomenon previously reported only in subduction zone environments. In 2016, a VLFE transitioned into an earthquake of magnitude 3.7 and was preceded by a 12-hour-long accelerating foreshock sequence. Benefiting from 12 seismic stations deployed within 30 km of the epicentre, we identify coincident radiation of distinct high-frequency and low-frequency waves during 22 s of nucleation. The power-law temporal growth of the nucleation signal is quantitatively predicted by a model in which high-frequency waves are radiated from the vicinity of an expanding slow slip front. The observations reveal the continuity and complexity of slip processes near the bottom of the seismogenic zone of a strike-slip fault system in central Alaska. A strike-slip fault zone in central Alaska exhibits a range of earthquake slip processes, including very-low-frequency earthquakes, some of which transition into regular, fast earthquakes.},

	abstract = {We summarize new observations of the deceleration and stick-slip motion of Whillans Ice Stream (WIS), Antarctica. We refine the location of the large sticky spots that resist motion between slip events, the locations of which are controlled by the patterns of subglacial water flow. Our examination of the long-term velocity time series for the ice stream reveals that the decadal-scale deceleration is not occurring at a steady rate, but varies at the sub-decadal timescale. This unsteady deceleration modulates the temporal evolution of a broad (\$50 km across) surface-elevation bulge forming at the junction between the relatively narrow upstream portion of the ice stream and broad ice plain that constitutes the downstream end of WIS. Comparison of observations from April 2003 and November 2010 reveals significant changes in the tidally modulated stick-slip cycle that regulates motion on the ice plain. We observe that the timing of slip events has become less regular in response to decreased flow speed in the upstream portions of the ice stream. The decreased regularity of slip events has reduced the release of stored elastic strain during slip events, increasing the rate of deceleration.},

	abstract = {The tidally modulated, stick-slip events of Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica produce seismic energy from three locations near the grounding line. Using ice velocity records obtained by combining time series from colocated broadband seismometers and GPS receivers installed on the ice stream during the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 austral summers, along with far-field seismic recordings of elastic waves, we locate regions of high rupture velocity and stress drop. These regions, which are analogous to "asperities" in traditional seismic fault studies, are areas of elevated friction at the base of the ice stream. Slip events consistently initiate at one of two locations: near the center of the ice stream, where events associated with the Ross Sea high tide originate, or a grounding-line spot, where events associated with the Ross Sea low tide initiate, as well as occasional high-tide events following a skipped low-tide event. The grounding-line site, but not the central site, produces Rayleigh waves observable up to 1000 km away, through fast expansion of the slip area. Grounding-line initiation events also show strong directivity in the downstream direction, indicating initial rupture propagation at 1.5 km/s, compared to an average of 0.150 km/s for the entire slip event. Following slip initiation, additional seismic energy is produced from two sources located near the grounding line: first at the downstream end of Subglacial Lake Engelhardt and second toward the farthest downstream extent of the ice stream. This evidence suggests that the stronger, higher-friction material along the grounding line controls motion throughout the stick-slip region.

	abstract = {Self-organized pattern formation is widespread and functionally significant. Scale-dependent feedback in space (short-distance positive feedback coupled with long-distance negative feedback) has been embraced as an arguably universal mechanism of ecological self-organization. Recently, intraspecific territorial competition has been proposed as a complementary mechanism contributing to spatial self-organization in ecology. In geomorphology, regular patterning is also widespread and has often been attributed to competition among geomorphic features. This mechanism has never been integrated into the framework of ecological pattern formation. Using the regularly patterned landscape of Big Cypress National Preserve in South Florida as a case study, we formalize a third mechanism of spatial self-organization: competition among pattern elements of finite amplitude stabilized by scale-dependent feedback in time. Depressions first accelerate their expansion rate via the positive feedback between depression volume and weathering rate. Later negative feedbacks become stronger, and eventually stabilize the size of depressions. While scale-dependent feedback in time provides a mechanism to stabilize individual depressions, it is the competition among depressions that induces spatial regularity. A relatively smaller depression could have a greater expansion rate than larger ones in its development. Higher weathering rate on the side of a divide toward the smaller depression causes migration of the divide to the larger depression. Consequently, the smaller depression expands its catchment area while the catchment area of the neighboring larger depression contracts, resulting in depressions achieving similar size and distance from each other. The diversity of regular patterns dictates the need to integrate perspectives from multiple disciplines.},

Scarce observations of migratory nucleation may result from real differences between faults or merely observational limitations. We use Global Positioning System and passive seismic records of the easily observed daily ice stream earthquake cycle of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica, to quantify the prevalence of migratory versus self-nucleation in a large-scale, natural stick-slip system. We find abundant and predominantly migratory precursory slip, whereas self-nucleation is nearly absent.

Although observations of such events are now widespread, the physical conditions promoting shallow slow-slip events remain poorly understood. Here we use full waveform inversion of controlled-source seismic data from the central Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction margin to constrain the physical conditions in a region hosting slow slip. We find that the subduction fault is characterized by compliant, overpressured and mechanically weak material. We identify sharp lateral variations in pore pressure, which reflect focused fluid flow along thrust faults and have a fundamental influence on the distribution of mechanical properties and frictional stability along the subduction fault. We then use high-resolution data-derived mechanical properties to underpin rate–state friction models of slow slip. These models show that shallow subduction fault rocks must be nearly velocity neutral to generate shallow frictional slow slip. Our results have implications for understanding fault-loading processes and slow transient fault slip along megathrust faults. A shallow slow-slip source region has laterally variable elastic properties and pore pressure, and near-velocity-neutral frictional properties, according to seismic imaging of part of the Hikurangi subduction margin and data-constrained modelling.},

	abstract = {Since their development in the 1960s, seismic arrays have given a new impulse to seismology. Recordings from many uniform seismometers in a well-defined, closely spaced configuration produce high-quality and homogeneous data sets, which can be used to study the Earth's structure in great detail. Apart from an improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio due to the simple summation of the individual array recordings, seismological arrays can be used in many different ways to study the fine-scale structure of the Earth's interior. They have helped to study such different structures as the interior of volcanos, continental crust and lithosphere, global variations of seismic velocities in the mantle, the coremantle boundary and the structure of the inner core. For this purpose many different, specialized array techniques have been developed and applied to an increasing number of high-quality array data sets. Most array methods use the ability of seismic arrays to measure the vector velocity of an incident wave front, i.e., slowness and back azimuth. This information can be used to distinguish between different seismic phases, separate waves from different seismic events and improve the signal-to-noise ratio by stacking with respect to the varying slowness of different phases. The vector velocity information of scattered or reflected phases can be used to determine the region of the Earth from whence the seismic energy comes and with what structures it interacted. Therefore seismic arrays are perfectly suited to study the small-scale structure and variations of the material properties of the Earth. In this review we will give an introduction to various array techniques which have been developed since the 1960s. For each of these array techniques we give the basic mathematical equations and show examples of applications. The advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate applications and restrictions of the techniques will also be discussed. The main methods discussed are the beam-forming method, which forms the basis for several other methods, different slant stacking techniques, and frequency-wave number analysis. Finally, some methods used in exploration geophysics that have been adopted for global seismology are introduced. This is followed by a description of temporary and permanent arrays installed in the past, as well as existing arrays and seismic networks. We highlight their purposes and discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of different array configurations.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews laboratory observations of earthquake initiation and describes new experiments on a 3-m rock sample where the nucleation process is imaged in detail. Many of the laboratory observations are consistent with previous work that showed a slow and smoothly accelerating earthquake nucleation process that expands to a critical nucleation length scale Lc, before it rapidly accelerates to dynamic fault rupture. The experiments also highlight complexities not currently considered by most theoretical and numerical models. This includes a loading rate dependency where a “kick” above steady state produces smaller and more abrupt initiation. Heterogeneity of fault strength also causes abrupt initiation when creep fronts coalesce on a stuck patch that is somewhat stronger than the surrounding fault. Taken together, these two mechanisms suggest a rate-dependent “cascade up” model for earthquake initiation. This model simultaneously accounts for foreshocks that are a by-product of a larger nucleation process and similarities between initial P wave signatures of small and large earthquakes. A diversity of nucleation conditions are expected in the Earth's crust, ranging from slip limited environments with Lc {\textless} 1 m, to ignition-limited environments with Lc {\textgreater} 10 km. In the latter case, Lc fails to fully characterize the initiation process since earthquakes nucleate not because a slipping patch reaches a critical length but because fault slip rate exceeds a critical power density needed to ignite dynamic rupture.},

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that it should be considered as prior information in rupture modeling. Here, we first present a mathematical formalism to introduce coupling models as prior information into stochastic rupture modeling. We then focus on how introducing slip deficit information into the stochastic rupture models influences slip distributions for the Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ). We compare rupture models created with two end member models of coupling, one with a shallow coupling and another with coupling deeper downdip. We also discuss the comparison to models created without assuming knowledge of the coupling distribution except for variation in the downdip limit of slip. Variations occur and correlate well with areas with the largest differences in slip deficit rates. The ruptures are then used for regional probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment. Overall, the tsunami amplitudes generated are much more hazardous in the northern extent of the CSZ where differences in coupling distribution are more prevalent. Models obtained from assuming a shallower downdip limit have tsunami amplitudes more similar to those from the geodetic coupling models. Although uncertainties are present in the accuracy of coupling, imposing either constraint created different hazard estimations when compared to those where no prior coupling information was used.},

Inversions for the distribution of aseismic slip rate along the ∼15°NW dipping underthrust suggest a nonslipping plate interface in southern Kamchatka above ∼50 km depth, along the segment that ruptured in the Mw = 9, 1952 earthquake. North of ∼53°N, the subduction interface experiences significant aseismic slip, consistent with the lower seismic moment release in M ≤ 8.5 earthquakes along this portion of the subduction zone. The GPS velocities are consistent with a boundary element forward model in which historic earthquake rupture zones are represented as locked asperities, surrounded by a zero shear stress subduction interface loaded by plate convergence. Models in which the complete rupture zones of historic earthquakes are considered locked greatly overpredict the degree of kinematic coupling. Reducing the area of the locked model asperities to the central 25\% area of historic rupture zones fits the data well, suggesting that large earthquakes involve small fully locked core asperities surrounded by conditionally stable portions of the plate interface. Areas of low aseismic slip rate appear to be roughly correlated with areas of low isostatic gravity anomalies over offshore forearc basins, while less coupled portions of the Kamchatka subduction zone coincide with high-gravity anomalies offshore of two peninsulas, possibly related to the subduction of the Emperor-Meji seamount chain and the Kruzenstern fracture zone.

	abstract = {Many large earthquakes are preceded by one or more foreshocks, but it is unclear how these foreshocks relate to the nucleation process of the mainshock. On the basis of an earthquake catalog created using a waveform correlation technique, we identified two distinct sequences of foreshocks migrating at rates of 2 to 10 kilometers per day along the trench axis toward the epicenter of the 2011 moment magnitude (Mw) 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in Japan. The time history of quasi-static slip along the plate interface, based on small repeating earthquakes that were part of the migrating seismicity, suggests that two sequences involved slow-slip transients propagating toward the initial rupture point. The second sequence, which involved large slip rates, may have caused substantial stress loading, prompting the unstable dynamic rupture of the mainshock.},

Our character-to-character model outperforms a recently proposed baseline with a subword-level encoder on WMT’15 DE-EN and CS-EN, and gives comparable performance on FI-EN and RU-EN. We then demonstrate that it is possible to share a single character-level encoder across multiple languages by training a model on a many-to-one translation task. In this multilingual setting, the character-level encoder significantly outperforms the subword-level encoder on all the language pairs. We observe that on CS-EN, FI-EN and RU-EN, the quality of the multilingual character-level translation even surpasses the models specifically trained on that language pair alone, both in terms of the BLEU score and human judgment.},

	abstract = {Graph-structured data is ubiquitous throughout the natural and social sciences, from telecommunication networks to quantum chemistry. Building relational inductive biases into deep learning architectures is crucial if we want systems that can learn, reason, and generalize from this kind of data. Recent years have seen a surge in research on graph representation learning, including techniques for deep graph embeddings, generalizations of convolutional neural networks to graph-structured data, and neural message-passing approaches inspired by belief propagation. These advances in graph representation learning have led to new state-of-the-art results in numerous domains, including chemical synthesis, 3D-vision, recommender systems, question answering, and social network analysis. The goal of this book is to provide a synthesis and overview of graph representation learning. We begin with a discussion of the goals of graph representation learning, as well as key methodological foundations in graph theory and network analysis. Following this, we introduce and review methods for learning node embeddings, including random-walk based methods and applications to knowledge graphs. We then provide a technical synthesis and introduction to the highly successful graph neural network (GNN) formalism, which has become a dominant and fast-growing paradigm for deep learning with graph data. The book concludes with a synthesis of recent advancements in deep generative models for graphs-a nascent, but quickly growing subset of graph representation learning.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have yielded immense success on speech recognition, computer vision and natural language processing. However, the exploration of deep neural networks on recommender systems has received relatively less scrutiny. In this work, we strive to develop techniques based on neural networks to tackle the key problem in recommendation -- collaborative filtering -- on the basis of implicit feedback. Although some recent work has employed deep learning for recommendation, they primarily used it to model auxiliary information, such as textual descriptions of items and acoustic features of musics. When it comes to model the key factor in collaborative filtering -- the interaction between user and item features, they still resorted to matrix factorization and applied an inner product on the latent features of users and items. By replacing the inner product with a neural architecture that can learn an arbitrary function from data, we present a general framework named NCF, short for Neural network-based Collaborative Filtering. NCF is generic and can express and generalize matrix factorization under its framework. To supercharge NCF modelling with non-linearities, we propose to leverage a multi-layer perceptron to learn the user-item interaction function. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show significant improvements of our proposed NCF framework over the state-of-the-art methods. Empirical evidence shows that using deeper layers of neural networks offers better recommendation performance.},

We construct a spontaneously propagating rupture model exhibiting these features and use it to explain ground motions recorded during the 2002 Denali fault earthquake at pump station 10, located 3 km from the fault.

However, the origin of this variation of the rupture velocity in nature as well as the physics behind it is still debated. Here, we first highlight how the different types of fault slip observed in nature appear to stem from the same physical mechanism. Second, we reproduce at the scale of the laboratory the complete spectrum of rupture velocities observed in nature. Our results show that the rupture velocity can range from a few millimetres to kilometres per second, depending on the available energy at the onset of slip, in agreement with theoretical predictions. This combined set of observations bring a new explanation of the dominance of slow rupture fronts in the shallow part of the crust or in areas suspected to present large fluid pressure. The authors show that seismogenic faults can be activated by stress perturbations by all possible modes of slip independently of the frictional properties. They demonstrate, that the nature of seismicity is mostly governed by the initial stress level along the faults.},

	abstract = {Ice plasticity has been thoroughly studied, owing to its importance in glaciers and ice sheets dynamics. In particular, its anisotropy (easy basal slip) has been suspected for a long time, then fully characterized 40 years ago. More recently emerged the interest of ice as a model material to study some fundamental aspects of crystalline plasticity. An example is the nature of plastic fluctuations and collective dislocation dynamics. Twenty years ago, acoustic emission measurements performed during the deformation of ice single crystals revealed that plastic 'flow' proceeds through intermittent dislocation avalanches, power law distributed in size and energy. This means that most of ice plasticity takes place through few, very large avalanches, thus qualifying associated plastic fluctuations as 'wild'. This launched an intense research activity on plastic intermittency in the Material Science community. The interest of ice in this debate is reviewed, from a comparison with other crystalline materials. In this context, ice appears as an extreme case of plastic intermittency, characterized by scale-free fluctuations, complex space and time correlations as well as avalanche triggering. In other words, ice can be considered as the paradigm of wild plasticity.

Recent experimental investigations clearly show that the plastic deformation of the ice single crystal and polycrystal is produced by intermittent dislocation bursts triggered by long-range interaction of dislocations. Such dislocation avalanches are associated with the formation of dislocation patterns in the form of slip lines and slip bands, which exhibit long-range correlations and scale invariance. Long-range dislocation interactions appear to play an essential role in primary creep of polycrystals and dynamic recrystallization. The large plastic anisotropy of the ice crystal is at the origin of large strain and stress heterogeneities within grains. The use of full-field approaches is now a compulsory proceeding to model the intracrystalline heterogeneities that develop in polycrystals. Ice is now highly regarded among the materials science community. It is considered a model material for understanding deformation processes of crystalline materials and polycrystal modeling.},

We propose a process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial invariance conjecture for symmetric groups 4. Our work may serve as a model for collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of mathematicians and machine learning.},

	abstract = {Following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, the Dipartimento della Protezione Civile Italiana (DPC), appointed an International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF) to report on the current state of knowledge of short-term prediction and forecasting of tectonic earthquakes and indicate guidelines for utilization of possible forerunners of large earthquakes to drive civil protection actions, including the use of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the wake of a large earthquake. The ICEF reviewed research on earthquake prediction and forecasting, drawing from developments in seismically active regions worldwide. A prediction is defined as a deterministic statement that a future earthquake will or will not occur in a particular geographic region, time window, and magnitude range, whereas a forecast gives a probability (greater than zero but less than one) that such an event will occur. Earthquake predictability, the degree to which the future occurrence of earthquakes can be determined from the observable behavior of earthquake systems, is poorly understood. This lack of understanding is reflected in the inability to reliably predict large earthquakes in seismically active regions on short time scales. Most proposed prediction methods rely on the concept of a diagnostic precursor; i.e., some kind of signal observable before earthquakes that indicates with high probability the location, time, and magnitude of an impending event. Precursor methods reviewed here include changes in strain rates, seismic wave speeds, and electrical conductivity; variations of radon concentrations in groundwater, soil, and air; fluctuations in groundwater levels; electromagnetic variations near and above Earth's surface; thermal anomalies; anomalous animal behavior; and seismicity patterns. The search for diagnostic precursors has not yet produced a successful short-term prediction scheme. Therefore, this report focuses on operational earthquake forecasting as the principle means for gathering and disseminating authoritative information about time-dependent seismic hazards to help communities prepare for potentially destructive earthquakes. On short time scales of days and weeks, earthquake sequences show clustering in space and time, as indicated by the aftershocks triggered by large events. Statistical descriptions of clustering explain many features observed in seismicity catalogs, and they can be used to construct forecasts that indicate how earthquake probabilities change over the short term. Properly applied, short-term forecasts have operational utility; for example, in anticipating aftershocks that follow large earthquakes. Although the value of long-term forecasts for ensuring seismic safety is clear, the interpretation of short-term forecasts is problematic, because earthquake probabilities may vary over orders of magnitude but typically remain low in an absolute sense ({\textgreater} 1\% per day). Translating such low-probability forecasts into effective decision-making is a difficult challenge. Reports on the current utilization operational forecasting in earthquake risk management were compiled for six countries with high seismic risk: China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Russia, United States. Long-term models are currently the most important forecasting tools for civil protection against earthquake damage, because they guide earthquake safety provisions of building codes, performance-based seismic design, and other risk-reducing engineering practices, such as retrofitting to correct design flaws in older buildings. Short-term forecasting of aftershocks is practiced by several countries among those surveyed, but operational earthquake forecasting has not been fully implemented (i.e., regularly updated and on a national scale) in any of them. Based on the experience accumulated in seismically active regions, the ICEF has provided to DPC a set of recommendations on the utilization of operational forecasting in Italy, which may also be useful in other countries. The public should be provided with open sources of information about the short-term probabilities of future earthquakes that are authoritative, scientific, consistent, and timely. Advisories should be based on operationally qualified, regularly updated seismicity forecasting systems that have been rigorously reviewed and updated by experts in the creation,delivery, and utility of earthquake information. The quality of all operational models should be evaluated for reliability and skill by retrospective testing, and they should be under continuous prospective testing against established long-term forecasts and alternative time-dependent models. Alert procedures should be standardized to facilitate decisions at different levels of government and among the public. Earthquake probability thresholds should be established to guide alert levels based on objective analysis of costs and benefits, as well as the less tangible aspects of value-of-information, such as gains in psychological preparedness and resilience. The principles of effective public communication established by social science research should be applied to the delivery of seismic hazard information. © 2011 by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.

	abstract = {The statistics of recurrence times in broad areas have been reported to obey universal scaling laws, both for single homogeneous regions and when averaged over multiple regions. These unified scaling laws are characterized by intermediate power law asymptotics. On the other hand, Molchan (2005) has presented a mathematical proof that if such a universal law exists, it is necessarily an exponential, in obvious contradiction with the data. First, we generalize Molchan's argument to show that an approximate unified law can be found which is compatible with the empirical observations when incorporating the impact of the Omori-Utsu law of earthquake triggering. We then develop the theory of the statistics of interevent times in the framework of the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model of triggered seismicity and show that the empirical observations can be fully explained. Our theoretical expression well fits the empirical statistics over the whole range of recurrence times, accounting for different regimes by using only the physics of triggering quantified by the Omori-Utsu law. The description of the statistics of recurrence times over multiple regions requires an additional subtle statistical derivation that maps the fractal geometry of earthquake epicenters onto the distribution of the average seismic rates in multiple regions. This yields a prediction in excellent agreement with the empirical data for reasonable values of the fractal dimension d ≈ 1.8, the average clustering ratio n ≈ 0.9, and the productivity exponent α ≈ 0.9 times the b value of the Gutenberg-Richter law.

	title = {Origin and {Nonuniversality} of the {Earthquake} {Interevent} {Time} {Distribution}},
	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.168501},
	abstract = {Many authors have modeled regional earthquake interevent times using a gamma distribution, whereby data collapse occurs under a simple rescaling of the data from different regions or time periods. We show, using earthquake data and simulations, that the distribution is fundamentally a bimodal mixture distribution dominated by correlated aftershocks at short waiting times and independent events at longer times. The much-discussed power-law segment often arises as a crossover between these two. We explain the variation of the distribution with region size and show that it is not universal. Over the past decade, much scientific attention has been focused on the distribution of waiting times between earthquake events within a region or catalog [1-6], whose form and origin have great importance for the development of physical or statistical models of earthquake dynamics. Most authors have explored these interevent times by fitting the empirical histograms to a gamma distribution, which has led to the suggestion of universality [1-3,7,8], even down to the scale of laboratory rock fracture experiments [9]. The idea that has enthusiastically been pursued is that a rescaling involving region size and magnitude cutoff [1], or simply the mean event rate [2], produces data collapse onto a universal gamma distribution. Much of this analysis, however, has been restricted to the use of data with an apparently stationary event rate (e.g., [2,8]) since mean event rates are otherwise poorly constrained; there is some evidence that nonstationary data analyzed in the method of Bak et al. do not collapse [10]. Further, it is common also to omit the shortest inter-event times from the analysis [1,2]; if these interevent times are included, the approximate data collapse is broken [4]. These common restrictions tend to filter out high rates of aftershocks and thereby introduce a strong selection bias in the data, leading us to question the proposed uni-versality. Recent analytic studies on the Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequences (ETAS) model, a process-based stochastic earthquake occurrence model [11], have indicated that the interevent time distribution is not universal, but may be approximately universal under some circumstances [12,13]. We first explore afresh the structure of global and regional earthquake interevent time series, then demonstrate how the observed range of interevent time distributions arise from well-known empirical laws of seismicity by presenting comparative results from simulations of the ETAS model. We show that the form of the interevent time distribution in both earthquake catalogs and simulations is generally bimodal, and is best described as a mixture distribution, formed by the different patterns associated with correlated and uncorrelated event pairs. The frequently cited power-law segment in the distribution [1,2,4] arises as a crossover between the two peaks of these distributions. Support for bimodality in the distribution can also be found in published literature involving real data [4,14], simulations [15], and analytic studies on the ETAS model [16], although no comment has, up to now, been made on the bimodal shape. We draw attention to it and present a physically-motivated, intuitive explanation for its origin. Simulations also provide a way around the stationar-ity problem and allow us definitively to reject the hypothesis of universality. While on short time scales the earthquake rate is inherently nonstationary, earthquakes in the long term are a stationary, albeit nonlinear process; their event rate converges slowly but definitely onto a well-defined value [17]. Using lengthy ETAS simulations, we are able to include strong aftershock activity in our inter-event time sequence and still confidently define a mean event rate. This is akin to using a small region (such as Southern California) but recording data for a very long time. As expected from the bimodality, the distributions only approximately rescale with the mean event rate when including a wider range of realistic seismic patterns in the analysis than is available currently in real catalogs [17,18]. Interevent time histograms for a global and a regional (Southern California) catalog are shown in Fig. 1. Our preferred way for plotting the data is shown in the left hand figures in which a clear distinction can be seen between the global data, which forms a single-peaked distribution, and the regional distribution, which appears more bimodal. More commonly, interevent time distributions are plotted in the form of the right hand figures where each frequency has been normalized by the bin width, which tends to smooth out the two bumps so they cannot readily be distinguished as such [Fig. 1(b) and 1(d)]. They can however be seen in some rescaled plots in the literature (e.g., [4]). It is important to highlight the evidence that these are real features and that the much-discussed gamma distribution is in fact only an approximate description of the interevent time histogram.},

	abstract = {The scaling properties of earthquake populations show remarkable similarities to those observed at or near the critical point of other composite systems in statistical physics. This has led to the development of a variety of different physical models of seismogenesis as a critical phenomenon, involving locally nonlinear dynamics, with simplified rheologies exhibiting instability or avalanche-type behavior, in a material composed of a large number of discrete elements. In particular, it has been suggested that earthquakes are an example of a "self-organized critical phenomenon" analogous to a sandpile that spontaneously evolves to a critical angle of repose in response to the steady supply of new grains at the summit. In this stationary state of marginal stability the distribution of avalanche energies is a power law, equivalent to the Gutenberg-Richter frequency-magnitude law, and the behavior is relatively insensitive to the details of the dynamics. Here we review the results of some of the composite physical models that have been developed to simulate seismogenesis on different scales during (1) dynamic slip on a preexisting fault, (2) fault growth, and (3) fault nucleation. The individual physical models share some generic features, such as a dynamic energy flux applied by tectonic loading at a constant strain rate, strong local interactions, and fluctuations generated either dynamically or by fixed material heterogeneity, but they differ significantly in the details of the assumed dynamics and in the methods of numerical solution. However, all exhibit critical or near-critical behavior, with behavior quantitatively consistent with many of the observed fractal or multifractal scaling laws of brittle faulting and earthquakes, including the Gutenberg-Richter law. Some of the results are sensitive to the details of the dynamics and hence are not strict examples of self-organized criticality. Nevertheless, the results of these different physical models share some generic statistical properties similar to the "universal" behavior seen in a wide variety of critical phenomena, with significant implications for practical problems in probabilistic seismic hazard evaluation. In particular, the notion of self-organized criticality (or near-criticality) gives a scientific rationale for the a priori assumption of "stationarity" used as a first step in the prediction of the future level of hazard. The Gutenberg-Richter law (a power law in energy or seismic moment) is found to apply only within a finite scale range, both in model and natural seismicity. Accordingly, the frequency-magnitude distribution can be generalized to a gamma distribution in energy or seismic moment (a power law, with an exponential tail). This allows extrapolations of the frequency-magnitude distribution and the maximum credible magnitude to be constrained by observed seismic or tectonic moment release rates. The answers to other questions raised are less clear, for example, the effect of the a priori assumption of a Poisson process in a system with strong local interactions, and the impact of zoning a potentially multifractal distribution of epicentres with smooth polygons. The results of some models show premonitory patterns of seismicity which could in principle be used as mainshock precursors. However, there remains no consensus, on both theoretical and practical grounds, on the possibility or otherwise of reliable intermediate-term earthquake prediction.},

We show how such interevent correlations arise simply because of a finite detection threshold, created by the limited sensitivity of the measurement apparatus, or used to subtract background activity or noise from the activity signal. Data from crack-propagation experiments and numerical simulations of a nonequilibrium crack-line model demonstrate how thresholding leads to correlated bursts of activity by separating the avalanche events into subavalanches. The resulting temporal subavalanche correlations are well described by our general scaling description of thresholding-induced correlations in crackling noise.},

	abstract = {Snow avalanches are a major natural hazard, endangering human life and infrastructure in mountainous areas throughout the world. In many countries with seasonally snow-covered mountains, avalanche-forecasting services reliably warn the public by issuing occurrence probabilities for a certain region. However, at present, a single avalanche event cannot be predicted in time and space. Much about the release process remains unknown, mainly because of the highly variable, layered character of the snowpack, a highly porous material that exists close to its melting point. The complex interaction between terrain, snowpack, and meteorological conditions leading to avalanche release is commonly described as avalanche formation. It is relevant to hazard mapping and essential to short-term forecasting, which involves weighting many contributory factors. Alternatively, the release process can be studied and modeled. This approach relies heavily on snow mechanics and snow properties, including texture. While the effect of meteorological conditions or changes on the deformational behavior of snow is known in qualitative or semi-quantitative manner, the knowledge of the quantitative relation between snow texture and mechanical properties is limited, but promising developments are under way. Fracture mechanical models have been applied to explain the fracture propagation, and micromechanical models including the two competing processes (damage and sintering) have been applied to explain snow failure. There are knowledge gaps between the sequence of processes that lead to the release of the snow slab: snow deformation and failure, damage accumulation, fracture initiation, and fracture propagation. Simultaneously, the spatial variability that affects damage, fracture initiation, and fracture propagation has to be considered. This review focuses on dry snow slab avalanches and shows that dealing with a highly porous media close to its melting point and processes covering several orders of scale, from the size of a bond between snow grains to the size of a mountain slope, will continue to be very challenging.

We detect basal icequakes beneath an ∼3-kmwide seismic sensor network installed on the Whillans Ice Plain (WIP) in West Antarctica, and we use S-wave back-projection to detect and locate thousands of basal icequakes occurring over 14 and 21 days in January 2014 and 2015, respectively. We find flow-parallel streaks of basal icequakes beneath the WIP, which we conjecture are related to the presence of megascale glacial lineations (MSGLs) indicated by ice-penetrating radar, with at least one streak originating in a local trough adjacent to a MSGL. Patterned basal seismicity can be caused by systematic spatial variation in basal pore pressure, bed-material frictional properties, or both. We interpret these flow-parallel icequake streaks as being due to frictionally heterogeneous bed materials in the presence of a streamlined ice-stream bed: bedform ridges correspond to aseismic, high-porosity deforming till, and some troughs to ephemeral exposures of deeper, seismogenic material such as lodged till or older sediments or rocks. Our results are consistent with MSGL formation by either erosion in troughs to expose deeper seismogenic material, or deposition of aseismic high-porosity till in bedform highs. Our results also suggest that evolving subglacial geomorphology can impact basal traction by reorganizing the spatial distribution of basal materials with varying mechanical properties.},

	abstract = {We study a plane circular model of a frictional fault using numerical methods. The model is dynamic since we specify the effective stress at the fault. In one model we assume that the fault appears instantaneously in the medium; in another, that the rupture nucleates at the center and that rupture proceeds at constant subsonic velocity until it suddenly stops. The total source slip is larger at the center and the rise time is also longer at the center of the fault. The dynamic slip overshoots the static slip by 15 to 35 per cent. As a consequence, the stress drop is larger than the effective stress and the apparent stress is less than one half the effective stress.The far-field radiation is discussed in detail. We distinguish three spectral regions. First, the usual constant low-frequency level. Second, an intermediate region controlled by the fault size and, finally, the high-frequency asymptote. The central region includes the corner frequency and is quite complicated. The corner frequency is shown to be inversely proportional to the width of the far-field displacement pulse which, in turn, is related to the time lag between the stopping phases. The average corner frequency of S waves v0s is related to the final source radius, a, by v0s = 0.21 β/α. The corner frequency of P waves is larger than v0s by an average factor of 1.5.},

In an ideal linear elastic medium, a propagating mode along the crack front with a velocity slightly less than the Rayleigh wave velocity, is found to exist.

Short wavelength radiation due to weak random heterogeneities tends to lead to this instability at low velocities. The implications of these results for the crack dynamics are discussed. [S0031-9007(97)03620-X] PACS numbers: 62.20.Mk, 03.40.Dz, 46.30.Nz, 81.40.Np The conditions under which solids fail by extension of preexisting cracks are quite well established [1], but the dynamics of crack-front propagation is poorly understood. Experiments show a variety of types of crack surfaces-including fractal roughness over a wide range of length scales [2]-and erratic dynamics of the local crack-front velocity [3]. Except for the uniform motion of a straight crack front in an ideal elastic solid, there has not been, until recently, much theoretical analysis of these problems. Indeed, even what determines in which direction a section of crack front will advance is not understood [4-6], although it is clear that this involves physics on smaller scales than the regime of continuum elasticity theory. This has been the subject of substantial recent attention [5,6], but the effects of heterogeneities, side branching, and other effects are only just starting to be addressed. In this paper, we consider a seemingly much simpler problem: the dynamics of a tensile (mode I) crack that is confined to a plane in a weakly heterogeneous material. In this case, the local dynamics of the crack front is determined by energy conservation, and we can therefore use continuum mechanics with the nonlinear small scale physics near the crack front just determining the local fracture toughness. But we shall see that, nevertheless, the combined effect of even weak heterogeneities and elastodynamics can be dramatic. In a scalar approximation to elasticity, Perrin and Rice [7] found that to lowest order in a weak randomness perturbation theory, heterogeneities in the fracture toughness led to slow-logarithmic in time-roughening of a planar crack front suggesting that this system does not reach a statistical steady state. In this paper, we first show that the dynamics of a tensile crack are very different from the scalar approximation. In particular, in an ideal system with constant fracture toughness, G, a mode I crack advancing with velocity y supports a propagating mode along the crack front with a velocity sy slightly lower than the Rayleigh wave velocity, c, and depending weakly on y. This mode, which does not exist in the scalar approximation, dramatically enhances the effects of weak heterogeneities. Furthermore, if the toughness Gy is not constant but decreases with velocity, the propagating mode-and hence the crack front-becomes unstable. A perturbative analysis of the effects of random local heterogeneities in an ideal system is found to yield an effective Gy whose contributions from short wavelength acoustic emission indeed make dG dy , 0 at least for yc small. We discuss these results and the possible scenarios suggested by them. We study a tensile crack confined to the plane y 0 with the crack open in the region x , Fz, t. The normal displacement has a discontinuity across the crack, i.e., u y y 0 1 fi u y y 0 2 , while the normal stresses, s iy y 0 6 vanish on the crack surfaces. Under an external load, the displacement field u y has a p Fz, t 2 x singularity at the crack front with an amplitude proportional to the local mode I stress intensity factor, K I z, t. As long as the crack remains planar, symmetry implies that the loading is purely mode I so we write K K I. The system is under a static load applied very far away so that for a straight crack at rest, (i.e., F const), K K ` const. The crack is considered to be initially at rest (at large negative times) and moves a total distance small compared to its length and the sample dimensions and for a time less than the sound travel times across the sample. If the crack front advances, F ! F 1 dF, an energy per unit area of new crack Gx Fz, t, z must be provided to the crack front in order to fracture the solid; in an ideal quasiequilibrium situation this is just twice the solid-vacuum interfacial energy density, although more generally it is the local fracture toughness that includes the effects of small scale physics for which linear continuum elasticity is not valid. The fracture energy will be provided to the crack front by a flux of stored elastic energy per unit area of new crack G z, t, F, which in general depends on the past history of the entire crack and its instantaneous local velocity ≠F ≠t. The dynamics of the crack is given by G z, t, Fz 0 , t 0 \# t Gx Fz, t, z (1) for all z and t. The available energy, G , has the general form G Ay z, t Gz, t, Fz 0 , t 0 , t , (2) where G, which is independent of ≠Fz, t≠t, is the available elastic energy at z, t for a crack at rest locally 0031-90079779(5)877(4)\$10.00},

	title = {Somewhat circular tensile cracks},
	volume = {33},
	abstract = {In this paper we apply the method developed by Rice [1], of solving for the elastic field of a crack with a front perturbed from some reference shape, to solve the elasticity problems of somewhat circular planar tensile cracks under arbitrary load distributions. The method is based on a known solution for the stress intensity factor along a circular crack due to a pair of wedge-opening point forces on its surfaces. A full solution, accurate to first order in the deviation from a circular shape, is derived for the stress intensity factor and the crack opening displacement distributions. The results of a perturbation in a harmonic wave form suggest that a circular crack, under axially symmetric loading, can be configurationaUy unstable (not grow as a circle), for loadings that increase in intensity with distance from the center. Circular cracks with harmonic shape perturbations are found to have the same form of variation of the stress intensity factor with arc length along the crack edge (to first order accuracy) as found in previous work for a half plane crack. As a test case for the perturbation solution, an elliptical planar tensile crack under uniform tension is viewed as being perturbed from a circular crack. Results derived from the perturbation formulae through numerical evaluation are compared with the exact solutions existing in the literature. The perturbation results show a very good match with the exact solutions even when the semi-axis lengths of the elliptical crack differ by a factor of two (and by as much as a factor of three when special choices of the reference circular crack location are made). This suggests that the perturbation procedure presented here, while theoretically exact only to first order, can be used to produce acceptable results for some planar cracks whose shapes deviate appreciably from a circle.},

Lack of large earthquakes in the instrumental record enlarges uncertainty of the recurrence time; the recurrence of large earthquakes is generally determined by extrapolation according to a magnitude-frequency relation. We enhance the seismological catalog of the Dead Sea Fault Zone by including a 220,000-year-long continuous large earthquake record based on seismites from the Dead Sea center. We constrain seismic shaking intensities via computational fluid dynamics modeling and invert them for earthquake magnitude. Our analysis shows that the recurrence time of large earthquakes follows a power-law distribution, with a mean of 1400 ± 160 years. This mean recurrence is notable shorter than the previous estimate of 11,000 years for the past 40,000 years. Our unique record confirms a clustered earthquake recurrence pattern and a group-fault temporal clustering model, and reveals an unexpectedly high seismicity rate on a slow-slipping plate boundary.},

	abstract = {Spectacular deformations observed in lake sediments in an earthquake prone region (Lisan Formation, pre-Dead Sea lake) appear in phases of laminar, moderate folds, billow-like asymmetric folds, coherent vortices, and turbulent chaotic structures. Power spectral analysis of the deformation indicates that the geometry robustly obeys a power-law of -1.89, similar to the measured value of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) turbulence in other environments. Numerical simulations are performed using properties of the layer materials based on measure-ments of the modern Dead Sea sediments, which are a reasonable analogue of Lake Lisan. The simulations show that for a given induced shear, the smaller the thickness of the layers, the greater is the turbulent deformation. This is due to the fact that although the effective viscosity increases (the Reynolds number decreases) the bulk Richardson number becomes smaller with decrease in the layer thickness. The latter represents the ratio between the gravitational potential energy of the stably strati ed sediments and the shear energy generated by the earthquake. Therefore, for thin layers, the shear energy density is larger and the KH instability mechanism becomes more ef cient. The peak ground acceleration (PGA) is related to the seismogenic shear established during the earthquake. Hence, a link is made between the observed thickness and geometry of a deformed layer with its causative earthquake's PGA. © 2010 Geological Society of America.},

These billow-like folds are strikingly similar to KHI structures and have been convincingly tied to earthquakes. Our analysis suggests a threshold for ground acceleration increasing with the thickness of the folded layers.

Therefore it is important to understand how the cross-field current instability and the shear-driven Kelvin- Helmholtz instability mutually interact and compete with the available free energy. As a first step, with the use of Hall-MHD theory and two-dimensional this paper investigates simulation, the development of the Kelvin-I-Ielmholtz instability for a thin current sheet with sheared velocity flow. It is found that a finite north-south field at the center of the neutral sheet inhibits the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability to some extent. However, the timescale of its growth is still sufficiently short, so that this instability may play a part in broadening the thin current sheet at the time of substorm expansion onset.},

The onset of the turbulence is triggered not only by secondary K-H instability but also by Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) instability at the density interface inside the normal K-H vortex, whose onset mechanisms are attributed to the centrifugal force of the rotating motion. The secondary R-T instability alters the macroscopic structure by transporting dense fluids to tenuous region, while the secondary K-H instability is just a seed for the turbulence.

We show that three factors enhance the instability: (1) a decrease in the thickness of the shear layer, (2) a decrease in the thickness of the current layer (relative to the shear layer), and (3) the proximity of the "current layer" to the outer edge of the shear layer. Although the maximum growth rate occurs for wave numbers roughly equal to the inverse of the semithickness of the shear layer, the velocity threshold for the onset of the instability is insensitive to the thickness. However, when the current layer is displaced from the center toward the outer edge of the shear layer, the threshold is dramatically reduced and the boundary layer can be rendered unstable by relatively •\_nmnll shear flows, suggesting that even the region close to the subsolar point could become unstable when the sheath flow is perpendicular to the magnetospheric magnetic field. This mode can be identified by characteristic profiles across the boundary layer: the plasma density, pressure, and magnetic field strength perturbations all peak near the center of the boundary layer. The transverse magnetic field fluctuations are largest around the current layer, while the radial motions dominnte near the inner edge of the boundary layer.},

Such sediment-laden flows have fluid-dynamic characteristics which are radically different from their clear-water counterparts. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that an increasing concentration of kaolinite results in a distinct change in velocity and turbulence structure in flows transitional between Newtonian and non-Newtonian behavior. Such transitional flows develop a lower region of reduced velocity that is separated from the overlying flow by a distinct shear layer. Large-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are generated along this shear layer and dominate both turbulence production and fluid mixing. These experimental results are used to interpret the formation of parallel laminae in turbiditic muds and propose a model for sediment sorting in a range of clay-rich flows. Non-Newtonian flows with low concentrations of kaolinite (∼ 4\% by volume) are devoid of both turbulent and cohesive strength at the shear velocities investigated. Deposition of coarser, noncohesive particles in such flows would be expected to be controlled entirely by differences in settling velocity, and the deposits would therefore be expected to be graded and massive.},

The formation of surface rivers could help prevent ice-shelf collapse if they can efficiently evacuate meltwater. Here we present observations of the evolution of a surface river into an ice-shelf estuary atop the Petermann Ice Shelf in northwest Greenland and identify a second estuary at the nearby Ryder Ice Shelf. This surface-hydrology process can foster fracturing and enhance calving. At the Petermann estuary, sea ice was observed converging at the river mouth upstream, indicating a flow reversal. Seawater persists in the estuary after the surrounding icescape is frozen. Along the base of Petermann estuary, linear fractures were initiated at the calving front and propagated upstream along the channel. Similar fractures along estuary channels shaped past large rectilinear calving events at the Petermann and Ryder ice shelves. Increased surface melting in a warming world will enhance fluvial incision, promoting estuary development and longitudinal fracturing orthogonal to ice-shelf fronts, and increase rectilinear calving. Estuaries could develop in Antarctica within the next half-century, resulting in increased calving and accelerating both ice loss and global sea-level rise. Ice-shelf surface rivers can form estuaries that promote fracturing and enhance calving, according to observations from the Petermann and Ryder ice shelves in Greenland.},

	abstract = {Subglacial bedforms are a range of landforms (10-105m long) shaped mostly in glacial sediments and are abundant on ice-sheet beds. Numerous explanations for their generation, especially of drumlins, have been proposed. Rather than viewing them as resulting from erosion or deposition directly by ice, Smalley and Unwin (1968) proposed that both might occur simultaneously if, beneath the glacier, a layer of lubricating sediment existed and ‘flowed’, conducting geomorphic work (erosion, deposition, shaping) of its own. This idea appears to have steered the field, leading perhaps to final resolution of the centuries-old problem of drumlin genesis. Here I trace how the idea evolved, leading to the conclusion that subglacial bedforms are emergent phenomena arising from self-organization in the coupled flow of ice, sediment and water. The ubiquity and patterning of bedforms appears to be well explained by a naturally arising flow instability in the subglacial system, and which has been demonstrated by analytical and numerical modelling. A problem for the instability theory is an apparent mismatch between predicted and observed sedimentological properties of bedforms. A distinction is made between emergent drumlins, drumlin clones and obstacle drumlins which helps explain some apparent contradictions, and a conceptual framework is erected that might form a basis for confronting the theory with the wealth of observational evidence that exists.},

	abstract = {Channel flows over erodible beds are susceptible to instabilities of the coupled fluid and sediment flow equations. The most dangerous mode usually takes the form of a migrating alternating bar instability propagating in the flow direction. Previous theories have assumed that the underlying flow is steady and here the theory is extended to the unsteady situation. Stability characteristics are calculated for large-amplitude oscillations superimposed on a mean flow. In addition it is found that the basic instability is convective and we address the receptivity problem for bars induced by flow oscillations interacting with spatial variations associated with seepage, channel width variations etc. The effect of unsteadiness in the weakly nonlinear situation is also discussed. A mechanism which allows flow oscillations to interact with migrating bars to produce a sinusoidal structure fixed in space which might be relevant to meander formation is discussed.},

Here we use a numerical model to investigate the implications of this instability mechanism for large-scale morphology over long timescales. Our simulations show growth of coastline perturbations that interact with each other to produce large-scale features that resemble various kinds of natural landforms, including the capes and cuspate forelands observed along the Carolina coast of southeastern North America. Wind and wave data from this area support our hypothesis that such an instability mechanism could be responsible for the formation of shoreline features at spatial scales up to hundreds of kilometres and temporal scales up to millennia.},

	abstract = {Particle-laden gravity currents propagating in stratified environments, such as turbidity currents induced by floods in estuaries or triggered by landslides in oceans, are important and complicated geophysical processes that require multidisciplinary studies. This paper numerically investigates the dynamic features of lock-release particle-laden gravity currents in linear stratification on a flat bed, with the main focus on the front velocity, entrainment ratio, and energy budget. The direct numerical simulations reveal that the suppressive effect of the ambient stratification on the turbulence may cause a particle-laden current to quickly lose momentum so that the near-constant front velocity of the particle-laden current cannot be maintained if no more particles are resuspended. After the acceleration stage, the entrainment ratio of a particle-laden gravity current barely changes with ambient stratification due to a combined effect from suppressed turbulent structures and deposition of particles. The energy-conversion process is accelerated by particle settling and is suppressed by ambient stratification. Specifically, because of the suppressive effect of a stronger stratification on the turbulence, a larger part of the energy is dissipated by microscopic Stokes flow around particles, while a smaller part of the energy is dissipated by the macroscopic convective motion of the fluids.},

We utilize the unique setting of the Dead Sea shores where rapidly falling water levels allow isolating boulder transport during individual storms. Guided by these observations, we develop a new model quantifying the critical wave height for a certain clast mass mobilization. Then, we obtain an expression for the longshore clast displacement under the fluid-induced pressure impulse of a given wave. Finally, we formulate the sorting enforced by wave-height distributions during a storm, demonstrating how sorting is a direct manifestation of regional hydroclimatology.},

	abstract = {Velocity pulsing has previously been observed in continuous turbidity currents in lakes and reservoirs, even though the input flow is steady. Several different mechanisms have been ascribed to the generation of these fluctuations, including Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instabilities that are related to surface lobes along the plunge line where the river enters the receiving water body and interfacial waves such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. However, the understanding of velocity pulsing in turbidity currents remains limited. Herein we undertake a stability analysis for inclined flows and compare it against laboratory experiments, direct numerical simulations, and field data from Lillooet Lake, Canada, and Xiaolangdi Reservoir, China, thus enabling an improved understanding of the formative mechanisms for velocity pulsing. Both RT and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are shown to be prevalent in turbidity currents depending on initial conditions and topography, with plunge line lobes and higher bulk Richardson numbers favoring RT instabilities. Other interfacial wave instabilities (Holmboe and Taylor-Caulfield) may also be present. While this is the most detailed analysis of velocity pulsing conducted to date, the differences in spatial scales between field, direct numerical simulations, and experiments and the potential complexity of multiple processes acting in field examples indicate that further work is required. In particular, there is a need for simultaneous field measurements at multiple locations within a given system to quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of such pulsing.},

	abstract = {Long-running gravity currents are flows that are submerged beneath a deep layer of quiescent fluid and they travel over long distances along inclined or horizontal surfaces. They are driven by the density difference between the current and the clear ambient fluid above. In this work we present results on highly resolved direct numerical simulations of turbid underflows that involve nearly 1 billion degrees of freedom. We assess the effect of bed slope on the flow statistics. We explore the turbulence dynamics of the interface in the classical sub-and supercritical regimes. We investigate the structure of interfacial turbulence and its relation to the turbulence statistic. A transcritical regime is identified where intermittent cascading interfacial instabilities appear. We investigate how departure from the self-sustaining equilibrium state may be the mechanism responsible for this cyclic evolution of the transcritical regime. turbid underflow {\textbar} turbidity current {\textbar} gravity current {\textbar} turbulence {\textbar} DNS L ong-running subaqueous gravity currents are driven by the density difference between the heavy fluid and the clear water above it. This density difference can be the result of salinity of the current's fluid or difference in temperature. Moreover, sediment-laden turbidity currents can be modeled as density currents in the limit where very fine, noncohesive sediment is suspended in the current. This limit is the focus of the present work. These energetic turbid underflows travel along the oceanic floor generating submarine channel systems (1, 2), where they interact with the sediment bed at the bottom by eroding and depositing sediment and with the clear fluid above by entraining ambient water into the current (3). Near-bed turbulence is of essence in these sediment-laden flows to keep the sediments in suspension. These currents can travel hundreds of kilometers and last for several days (4-6). Direct monitoring of these energetic events and the resulting deposits is an ongoing challenge. An enlightening discussion on the key future research directions on turbidity currents and their deposits is presented in ref. 7. For these flows, two different flow regimes are well recognized: the supercritical regime where interfacial disturbances cannot travel upstream versus the subcritical regime where the velocity of the current is sufficiently low that disturbances can travel upstream. These two regimes are parametrically demarcated by the densimetric Froude Fr or equivalently the bulk Richardson number Ri of unity (8). The densimetric Froude number Fr is defined as the ratio between inertial and buoyancy effects and can be computed as Fr = (1 hu ∞ 0 u dz)/(∞ 0 c dz / tan θ) 1/2 , where u and c are the averaged streamwise velocity and concentration , respectively, and hu is the top edge of the current where streamwise velocity is negligible. Note that the bulk Richardson number can be computed as Ri = 1/Fr 2 = ∞ 0 c dz /(tan θ(1 hu ∞ 0 u dz) 2). When the Fr of a current flowing down a steep (or gentle) slope is sufficiently greater (or less) than unity, it can remain supercritical (or subcritical) and slowly evolve over very long distances. Such a slow evolution over very long distances is possible due to near equilibrium between the excess weight of suspended sediments along the downslope direction and the total drag at both the bottom and the top of the current. At equilibrium, a supercritical current is characterized by strong energetic mixing at the interface between the current and the ambient fluid and a velocity profile (Fig. 1A) that resembles the nose-down shape of a wall jet (9, 10). As a result of strong mixing by turbulence at both the interface (above the velocity maximum) and the wall region (below the velocity maximum), the sediment concentration follows a Rousian profile (11). At equilibrium, a subcritical current is characterized by a stable interface with little mixing between the current and the ambient (Fig. 1B) and a nose-up velocity profile (12, 13). The sediment concentration in an equilibrium subcritical current is constant with height and is capped by a lutocline of abrupt drop in sediment concentration (12). In this work we report on the existence of an intermediate transcritical regime through which the current undergoes a soft parametric transition between the subcritical and super-critical regimes. We study the properties of the hitherto unex-plored transcritical regime through direct numerical simulations of heavier-than-ambient underflows (Fig. 1C). The nature of Significance Gravity currents are predominantly horizontal flows driven by the density difference between the current's fluid and the ambient fluid above. The two well-established flow regimes are the supercritical and subcritical regimes. We report on the existence of an intermediate transcritical regime where the flow along the interface undergoes a cyclical transition between quiescent and highly intermittent turbulent states. While the current slowly evolves in the subcritical and supercritical regimes in a near self-similar manner (akin to dynamics near a stable fixed point), the transcritical current with its unique cyclical evolution exhibits a limit-cycle-like behavior. This phenomenon has hitherto been unreported, since it requires highly resolved simulations over very long streamwise length involving about 1 billion grid points.},

We validate our results with 9 double-differential TerraSAR-X interferograms. It is necessary to make adjustments to the tidal forcing to directly compare observations with model output and we find that when these adjustments are small ({\textless}1.5 cm) a viscoelastic model matches better, while an elastic model is more robust overall. Within landward embayments, where lateral stresses fromsurrounding protrusions damp the flexural response, a 2-Dmodel captures behavior that is missed in simple 1-D models.

	abstract = {Ocean swell interacting with Antarctic ice shelves produces sustained (approximately, 2×106 cycles per year) gravity-elastic perturbations with deformation amplitudes near the ice front as large as tens to hundreds of nanostrain. This process is the most energetically excited during the austral summer, when sea ice-induced swell attenuation is at a minimum. A 2014-2017 deployment of broadband seismographs on the Ross Ice shelf, which included three stations sited, approximately, 2 km from the ice front, reveals prolific swell-associated triggering of discrete near-ice-front (magnitude≥0) seismic subevents, for which we identify three generic types. During some strong swell episodes, subevent timing becomes sufficiently phase-locked with swell excitation, to create prominent harmonic features in spectra calculated across sufficiently lengthy time windows via a Dirac comb effect, for which we articulate a theoretical development for randomized interevent times. These events are observable at near-front stations, have dominant frequency content between 0.5 and 20 Hz, and, in many cases, show highly repetitive waveforms. Matched filtering detection and analysis shows that events occur at a low-background rate during all swell states, but become particularly strongly excited during large amplitude swell at rates of up to many thousands per day. The superimposed elastic energy from swell-triggered sources illuminates the shelf interior as extensional (elastic plate) Lamb waves that are observable more than 100 km from the ice edge. Seismic swarms show threshold excitation and hysteresis with respect to rising and falling swell excitation. This behavior is consistent with repeated seismogenic fracture excitation and growth within a near-ice-front damage zone, encompassing fracture features seen in satellite imagery. A much smaller population of distinctly larger near-front seismic events, previously noted to be weakly associated with extended periods of swell perturbation, likely indicate calving or other larger-scale ice failures near the shelf front.},

The model is solved using a coupled finite element method incorporating an integral equation boundary condition to represent the radiation of energy in the infinite fluid. The solution is validated by comparison with thin-beam theory and by checking energy conservation. Using the analyticity of the resulting linear system, we show that the finite element solution can be extended to the complex plane using interpolation of the linear system.

	abstract = {Disintegration of ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula over the past two decades has clearly demonstrated their high sensitivity to recent changes in the local thermal regime of the atmosphere and ocean and has given rise to the question of whether mechanical coupling with waves in the ocean may provide the triggering mechanism that starts collapse events. Motivated by these events, this study considers a more general question: how ocean waves affect the stress regime of floating ice, and in particular, how ocean waves can influence the creation of fractures and its fatiguing that may lead to breakup and collapse. A new treatment of ice shelf/ocean wave interaction in which the typical "thin plate" approximation is relaxed is presented here, and exact, analytic solutions describing ice shelf stresses induced by long ({\textgreater}60 s period) ocean waves in various idealized ice/ocean geometries are derived. The numerical calculations demonstrate that the amplitudes of the wave-induced stresses are sufficiently large to initiate top to bottom crevasse penetration through the depth of the ice shelf. The cyclic nature of the wave-induced stresses contributes to ice fatigue and damage that is also a precursor to ice shelf disintegration. Although primarily theoretical, the results of the present analysis suggest that ocean waves could be a potential trigger of ice shelf collapse as well as less dramatic, but equally important, episodic calving.

	abstract = {Distant storms, tsunamis, and earthquakes generate waves on floating ice shelves. Previous studies, however, have disagreed about whether the resulting wave-induced stresses may cause ice shelf rift propagation. Most ice shelf rifts show long periods of dormancy suggesting that they have low background stress concentrations and may therefore be susceptible to wave-induced stresses. Here I quantify wave-induced stresses on the Ross Ice Shelf Nascent Rift and the Amery Ice Shelf Loose Tooth T2 Rift using passive seismology. I then relate these stresses to a fracture mechanical model of rift propagation that accounts for rift cohesive strength due to refrozen melange, ice inertia, and spatial heterogeneity in fracture toughness due to the presence of high toughness suture zones. I infer wave-induced stresses using the wave impedance tensor, a rank three tensor that relates seismically observable particle velocities to components of the stress tensor. I find that wave-induced stresses are an order of magnitude larger on the Ross Ice Shelf as compared to the Amery Ice Shelf. In the absence of additional rift strength, my model predicts that the Nascent Rift should have experienced extensive rift propagation. The observation that no such propagation occurred during this time therefore suggests that the Nascent Rift experiences strengthening from either refrozen melange or rift tip processes zone dynamics. This study illustrates one way in which passive seismology may illuminate glacier calving physics.},

In contrast, layered composite fluids are sometimes observed in confined systems of rather chaotic initial states, for example, lattes formed by pouring espresso into a glass of warm milk. Here, we report controlled experiments injecting a fluid into a miscible phase and show that, above a critical injection velocity, layering emerges over a time scale of minutes. We identify critical conditions to produce the layering, and relate the results quantitatively to double-diffusive convection. Based on this understanding, we show how to employ this single-step process to produce layered structures in soft materials, where the local elastic properties vary step-wise along the length of the material.},

	abstract = {The Whillans Ice Plain (WIP), Antarctica, experiences twice daily tidally modulated stick-slip cycles. Slip events last about 30 min, have sliding velocities as high as ∼0.5 mm/s (15 km/yr), and have total slip ∼0.5 m. Slip events tend to occur during falling ocean tide: just after high tide and just before low tide. To reproduce these characteristics, we use rate-and-state friction, which is commonly used to simulate tectonic faulting, as an ice stream sliding law. This framework describes the evolving strength of the ice-bed interface throughout stick-slip cycles. We present simulations that resolve the cross-stream dimension using a depth-integrated treatment of an elastic ice layer loaded by tides and steady ice inflow. Steady sliding with rate-weakening friction is conditionally stable with steady sliding occurring for sufficiently narrow ice streams relative to a nucleation length. Stick-slip cycles occur when the ice stream is wider than the nucleation length or, equivalently, when effective pressures exceed a critical value. Ice streams barely wider than the nucleation length experience slow-slip events, and our simulations suggest that the WIP is in this slow-slip regime. Slip events on the WIP show a sense of propagation, and we reproduce this behavior by introducing a rate-strengthening region in the center of the otherwise rate-weakening ice stream. If pore pressures are raised above a critical value, our simulations predict that the WIP would exhibit quasi-steady tidally modulated sliding as observed on other ice streams. This study validates rate-and-state friction as a sliding law to describe ice stream sliding styles.},

	abstract = {We study the morphodynamics of reversing dunes on the gravel deposits of the alluvial fan of the Molcha river at the border between the Tibetan Plateau and the Taklamakan Desert. Independent sets of wind data show that this area of low sand availability is exposed to two prevailing winds from opposite directions and of different strengths. The predicted resultant transport direction of sand particles is westward. Nevertheless, satellite observations combined with field measurements and ground-penetrating radar surveys reveal that isolated dunes a few meters high migrate eastward. This apparent dune migration paradox is resolved using numerical and analytical models that take into account the speed-up effect and the continuous change in dune shape after each wind reversal. When a newly established wind hits what was before the steeper lee slope of the dune, the sand flux at the crest abruptly increases before relaxing back to a constant value as the crest migrates downwind and as the dune reaches a new steady shape. Integrated over the entire wind cycle, we find that this non-linear behavior causes reversing dunes to migrate against the resultant transport direction. This migration reflects the difference in dune slope seen by irregular storm events blowing to the east and the westward wind of the daily cycle. Thus, we explore the impact of extreme events on dune morphodynamics and examine new aspects of the permanent feedback between dune topography and wind speed. We conclude that transient behaviors associated with crest reversals contribute to the observed diversity of dune patterns, even within the same area for dunes of different sizes.},

	abstract = {We quantify sliding stability and rupture styles for a horizontal interface between an elastic layer and stiffer elastic half-space with a free surface on top and rate-and-state friction on the interface. This geometry includes shallowly dipping subduction zones, landslides, and ice streams. Specific motivation comes from quasiperiodic slow slip events on the Whillans Ice Plain in West Antarctica. We quantify the influence of layer thickness on sliding stability, specifically whether a steadily loaded system produces steady sliding or stick-slip sequences. We do this using both linear stability analysis and nonlinear earthquake sequence simulations. We restrict our attention to the 2-D antiplane shear problem but anticipate that our findings generalize to more complex 2-D in-plane and 3-D problems. Steady sliding with velocity-weakening rate-and-state friction is linearly unstable to Fourier mode perturbations having wavelengths greater than a critical wavelength (λc). We quantify the dependence of λc on the rate-and-state friction parameters, elastic properties, loading, and the layer thickness (H). Confirming previous studies, we find that λc ∝ H1/2 for small H and is independent of H for large H. The linear stability analysis provides insight into nonlinear earthquake sequence dynamics of a nominally velocity-strengthening interface containing a velocity-weakening region of width W. Sequence simulations reveal a transition from steady sliding at small W to stick-slip events when W exceeds a critical width (Wcr), with Wcr ∝ H1/2 for small H. Overall, this study demonstrates that the reduced stiffness of thin layers promotes instability, with implications for sliding dynamics in thin layer geometries.},

This task remains challenging due to a lack of in situ observations. We analyze continuous seismic data from the Whillans Ice Plain (WIP), West Antarctica, to uncover spatio-temporal patterns in subglacial conditions. We exploit tidally modulated stick-slip events as a natural source of sliding variability. We observe a significant reduction of the till seismic wave-speed between the WIP sticky-spots. These observations are consistent with a poroelastic model where the bed experiences relative porosity and effective pressure increases of {\textgreater}11\% during stick-slips.

	abstract = {Instability in homogeneous and density stratified shear flows may be interpreted in terms of the interaction of two (or more) otherwise free waves in the velocity and density profiles. These waves exist on gradients of vorticity and density, and instability results when two fundamental conditions are satisfied: (I) the phase speeds of the waves are stationary with respect to each other (“phase-locking”), and (II) the relative phase of the waves is such that a mutual growth occurs. The advantage of the wave interaction approach is that it provides a physical interpretation to shear flow instability. This paper is largely intended to purvey the basics of this physical interpretation to the reader, while both reviewing and consolidating previous work on the topic. The interpretation is shown to provide a framework for understanding many classical and nonintuitive results from the stability of stratified shear flows, such as the Rayleigh and Fjortoft theorems, and the destabilizing effect of an otherwise stable density stratification. Finally, we describe an application of the theory to a geophysical-scale flow in the Fraser River estuary. © 2011 by ASME.},

Phase-field simulations reproduce these morphologies, which are closely linked to the anomalous density-temperature profile of liquid water. Boundary layer flows yield pinnacles that sharpen with accelerating growth of tip curvature while scallops emerge from a Kelvin-Helmholtz–like instability caused by counterflowing currents that roll up to form vortex arrays.

Liu in 1957 but not tested because of the complex nature of the measurements required. The theory is based on the idea that a moving sand bed might be likened to a dense fluid and that a hydrodynamic instability develops at the interface between the sediment transport layer and the near-bed fluid, leading to the organization of the transport system into laterally extended, discrete bed forms. Our predicted initial bed form lengths are within 10\% of the lengths observed in a series of flume experiments, suggesting that transverse waveforms on sand beds sheared by unidirectional currents can be initiated as an interfacial hydrodynamic instability of Kelvin-Helmholtz type when the current is sufficiently vigorous to produce general sediment movement, that is, to create a sediment transport layer that acts as a pseudofluid with density composed of solid and fluid components.},

Following Vere-Jones' [1969] and Console et al.

We use the ETAS model of seismicity, which provides a more realistic model of aftershocks, based on (i) a universal Gutenberg-Richter (GR) law for all earthquakes, and on (ii) the increase of the number of aftershocks with the mainshock magnitude. Using numerical simulations of the ETAS model, we show that this model is in good agreement with Båth's law in a certain range of the model parameters.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} We invoke a metric to quantify the correlation between any two earthquakes. This provides a simple and straightforward alternative to using space-time windows to detect aftershock sequences and obviates the need to distinguish main shocks from aftershocks. Directed networks of earthquakes are constructed by placing a link, directed from the past to the future, between pairs of events that are strongly correlated. Each link has a weight giving the relative strength of correlation such that the sum over the incoming links to any node equals unity for aftershocks, or zero if the event had no correlated predecessors. A correlation threshold is set to drastically reduce the size of the data set without losing significant information. Events can be aftershocks of many previous events, and also generate many aftershocks. The probability distribution for the number of incoming and outgoing links are both scale free, and the networks are highly clustered. The Omori law holds for aftershock rates up to a decorrelation time that scales with the magnitude, \textit{m}, of the initiating shock as \textit{t}$_{\textrm{cutoff}}${\textasciitilde}10$^{\textrm{\&beta; m}}$ with \&beta;{\textasciitilde}-3/4. Another scaling law relates distances between earthquakes and their aftershocks to the magnitude of the initiating shock. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis of finite aftershock zones. We also find evidence that seismicity is dominantly triggered by small earthquakes. Our approach, using concepts from the modern theory of complex networks, together with a metric to estimate correlations, opens up new avenues of research, as well as new tools to understand seismicity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The importance of seismological research around the globe is very clear. Therefore, new tools and algorithms are needed in order to predict magnitude, time, and geographic location, as well as to discover relationships that allow us to better understand this phenomenon and thus be able to save countless human lives. However, given the highly random nature of earthquakes and the complexity in obtaining an efficient mathematical model, efforts until now have been insufficient and new methods that can contribute to solving this challenge are needed. In this work, a novel earthquake magnitude prediction method is proposed, which is based on the composition of a known system whose behavior is governed according to the measurements of more than two decades of seismic events and is modeled as a time series using machine learning, specifically a network architecture based on LSTM (long short-term memory) cells.},

Identifying a broadened forecasting procedure for general models of space–time magnitude sequences may enhance the information gain of earthquake forecasts. This article explores and evaluates three such models for earthquake magnitude forecasting. The first model forecasts magnitudes by location‐dependent b‐values; the second model forecasts magnitudes by space–time weighted moving average of the short‐term past and neighboring magnitude sequence; and the third forecasts based on short‐term tightness of clustering among earthquakes. The forecasting performances of these models estimated in a learning period are shown at each time in a testing period. Except for the last example, the forecasts do not outperform the baseline G‐R law with the b‐value of 0.9. We discuss the reasons by some residual analysis.},

We design a regressor (MagNet) composed of convolutional and recurrent neural networks that is not sensitive to the data normalization, hence waveform amplitude information can be utilized during the training. The network can learn distance-dependent and site-dependent functions directly from the training data. Our model can predict local magnitudes with an average error close to zero and standard deviation of 0.2 based on single-station waveforms without instrument response correction. We test the network for both local and duration magnitude scales and show a station-based learning can be an effective approach for improving the performance. The proposed approach has a variety of potential applications from routine earthquake monitoring to early warning systems.},

	abstract = {It is documented that a few days or weeks before major Earthquakes (EQs) there are changes in animal behavior within distances up to 500 km from the seismic epicenter. At the same time Seismic Electric Signals (SES), geomagnetic and ionospheric perturbations, are detected within similar distances. SES consist of single unipolar pulses, and/or groups of such pulses called “SES activities” with an average frequency between successive pulses on the order of {\textasciitilde}0.01 Hz and electric field intensity on the order of {\textasciitilde}10−5–10−4 V/m (Frazer-Smith et al., 1990; Rikitake, 1998; Varotsos et al., 1993, 2011, 2019; Hayakawa et al., 2013; Grant et al., 2015). We show that the SES activities can be sensed by living organisms through the “Ion Forced-Oscillation Mechanism” for the action of Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) on cells, according to which polarized EMFs can cause irregular gating of electro-sensitive ion channels on the cell membranes with consequent disruption of the cell electrochemical balance (Panagopoulos et al., 2000, 2002, 2015). This can be sensed by sensitive animals as discomfort in cases of weak and transient exposures, and may even lead to DNA damage and serious health implications in cases of intense exposure conditions (as in certain cases of man-made EMF exposures). Moreover, we show that the geomagnetic and ionospheric perturbations cannot be sensed through this mechanism. The same mechanism has explained meteoropathy, the sensing of upcoming thunderstorms by sensitive individuals, through the action of the EMFs of lightning discharges (Panagopoulos and Balmori, 2017). The present study shows that centuries-long anecdotal rumors of animals sensing intense upcoming EQs and displaying unusual behavior, lately documented by systematic studies, are now explained for the first time on the basis of the electromagnetic nature of all living organisms, and the electromagnetic signals emitted prior to EQs.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a conception of complex multidisciplinary approach to the problem of clarification the nature of short-term earthquake precursors observed in atmosphere, atmospheric electricity and in ionosphere and magnetosphere. Our approach is based on the most fundamental principles of tectonics giving understanding that earthquake is an ultimate result of relative movement of tectonic plates and blocks of different sizes. Different kind of gases: methane, helium, hydrogen, and carbon dioxide leaking from the crust can serve as carrier gases for radon including underwater seismically active faults. Radon action on atmospheric gases is similar to the cosmic rays effects in upper layers of atmosphere: it is the air ionization and formation by ions the nucleus of water condensation. Condensation of water vapor is accompanied by the latent heat exhalation is the main cause for observing atmospheric thermal anomalies. Formation of large ion clusters changes the conductivity of boundary layer of atmosphere and parameters of the global electric circuit over the active tectonic faults. Variations of atmospheric electricity are the main source of ionospheric anomalies over seismically active areas. Lithosphere–Atmosphere–Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC) model can explain most of these events as a synergy between different ground surface, atmosphere and ionosphere processes and anomalous variations which are usually named as short-term earthquake precursors. A newly developed approach of Interdisciplinary Space–Terrestrial Framework (ISTF) can provide also a verification of these precursory processes in seismically active regions. The main outcome of this paper is the unified concept for systematic validation of different types of earthquake precursors united by physical basis in one common theory.},

Here we suggest an alternative in which stably stratified layers undergo a shear instability during relative sliding via the Kelvin–Helmholtz Instability (KHI) mechanism, triggered by earthquake shaking. Dead Sea sediments have long stood out as a classical and photogenic example for recumbent folding of soft sediment. These billow-like folds are strikingly similar to KHI structures and have been convincingly tied to earthquakes. Our analysis suggests a threshold for ground acceleration increasing with the thickness of the folded layers. The maximum thickness of folded layers (order of decimeters) corresponds to ground accelerations of up to 1 g. Such an acceleration occurs during large earthquakes, recurring in the Dead Sea.},

In order to confirm the morphology of the structure, the authors excavated two trenches and an opencast pit. When viewed in a cross-section oriented parallel to the direction of the runup current, the deformed boundary has an irregularly bulging profile, similar to that observed in flame structures.

	abstract = {With the growing involvement of fathers in childrearing and the application of neuroscientific tools to research on parenting, there is a need to understand how a father's brain and neurohormonal systems accommodate the transition to parenthood and how such neurobiological changes impact children's mental health, sociality, and family functioning. In this paper, we present a theoretical model on the human father’s brain and the neural adaptations that take place when fathers assume an involved role. The neurobiology of fatherhood shows great variability across individuals, societies, and cultures and is shaped to a great extent by bottom-up caregiving experiences and the amount of childrearing responsibilities.

In this paper, we present a theoretical model on the human father’s brain and the neural adaptations that take place when fathers assume an involved role.

Apparently, earthquakes occur without warning and can devastate entire cities in just a few seconds, causing numerous casualties and huge economic loss. Great effort has been directed towards being able to predict these natural disasters, and taking precautionary measures. However, simultaneously predicting when, where and the magnitude of the next earthquake, within a limited region and time, seems an almost impossible task. Techniques from the field of data mining are providing new and important information to researchers. This article reviews the use of artificial neural networks for earthquake prediction in response to the increasing amount of recently published works and presenting claims of being effective.

	abstract = {In this paper, a deep learning-based method for earthquake prediction is proposed. Large-magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis triggered by earthquakes can kill thousands of people and cause millions of dollars worth of economic losses. The accurate prediction of large-magnitude earthquakes is a worldwide problem. In recent years, deep learning technology that can automatically extract features from mass data has been applied in image recognition, natural language processing, object recognition, etc., with great success. We explore to apply deep learning technology to earthquake prediction. We propose a deep learning method for continuous earthquake prediction using historical seismic events. First, we project the historical seismic events onto a topographic map. Taking Taiwan as an example, we generate the images of the dataset for deep learning and mark a label “1” or “0”, depending on whether in the upcoming 30 days a greater than M6 earthquake will occur. Second, we train our deep leaning network model, using the images of the dataset. Finally, we make earthquake predictions, using the trained network model. The result shows that we can get the best result, when we predict earthquakes in the upcoming 30 days using data from the past 120 days. Here, we use R score as the performance metrics. The best R score is 0.303. Although the R score is not high enough, using the past 120 days’ historic seismic event to predict the upcoming 30 days’ biggest earthquake magnitude can be seen as the pattern of Taiwan earthquake because the R score is rather good compared to other datasets. The proposed method performs well without manually designing feature vectors, as in the traditional neural network method. This method can be applied to earthquake prediction in other seismic zones.},

The indicators are selected based on the Gutenberg-Richter and characteristic earthquake magnitude distribution and also on the conclusions drawn by recent earthquake prediction studies. Since there is no known established mathematical or even empirical relationship between these indicators and the location and magnitude of a succeeding earthquake in a particular time window, the problem is modeled using three different neural networks: a feed-forward Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (LMBP) neural network, a recurrent neural network, and a radial basis function (RBF) neural network. Prediction accuracies of the models are evaluated using four different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the true skill score or R score. The models are trained and tested using data for two seismically different regions: Southern California and the San Francisco bay region. Overall the recurrent neural network model yields the best prediction accuracies compared with LMBP and RBF networks. While at the present earthquake prediction cannot be made with a high degree of certainty this research provides a scientific approach for evaluating the short-term seismic hazard potential of a region.},

	abstract = {In the last years, deep learning has solved seemingly intractable problems, boosting the hope to find (approximate) solutions to problems that now are considered unsolvable. Earthquake prediction - a recognized moonshot challenge - is obviously worthwhile exploring with deep learning. Although encouraging results have been obtained recently, deep neural networks (DNN) may sometimes create the illusion that patterns hidden in data are complex when this is not necessarily the case. We investigate the results of De Vries et al. [Nature, vol. 560, 2018] who defined a DNN of 6 hidden layers with 50 nodes each, and with an input layer of 12 stress features, to predict aftershock patterns in space. The performance of their DNN was assessed using ROC with AUC = 0.85 obtained. We first show that a simple artificial neural network (ANN) of 1 hidden layer yields a similar performance, suggesting that aftershock patterns are not necessarily highly abstract objects. Following first principle guidance, we then bypass the elastic stress change tensor computation, making profit of the tensorial nature of neural networks. AUC = 0.85 is again reached with an ANN, now with only two geometric and kinematic features. Not only seems deep learning to be “excessive” in the present case, the simpler ANN streamlines the process of aftershock forecasting, limits model bias, and provides better insights into aftershock physics and possible model improvement. Complexification is a controversial trend in all of Science and first principles should be applied wherever possible to gain physical interpretations of neural networks.},

Prediction has been made on the basis of mathematically calculated eight seismic indicators using the earthquake catalog of the region. These parameters are based on the well-known geophysical facts of Gutenberg–Richter’s inverse law, distribution of characteristic earthquake magnitudes and seismic quiescence. In this research, four machine learning techniques including pattern recognition neural network, recurrent neural network, random forest and linear programming boost ensemble classifier are separately applied to model relationships between calculated seismic parameters and future earthquake occurrences. The problem is formulated as a binary classification task and predictions are made for earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 5.5 (\$\$M {\textbackslash}ge\$\$5.5), for the duration of 1 month. Furthermore, the analysis of earthquake prediction results is carried out for every machine learning classifier in terms of sensitivity, specificity, true and false predictive values. Accuracy is another performance measure considered for analyzing the results.

	abstract = {Aftershocks are a response to changes in stress generated by large earthquakes and represent the most common observations of the triggering of earthquakes. The maximum magnitude of aftershocks and their temporal decay are well described by empirical laws (such as Bath’s law1 and Omori’s law2), but explaining and forecasting the spatial distribution of aftershocks is more difficult. Coulomb failure stress change3 is perhaps the most widely used criterion to explain the spatial distributions of aftershocks4–8, but its applicability has been disputed9–11. Here we use a deep-learning approach to identify a static-stress-based criterion that forecasts aftershock locations without prior assumptions about fault orientation. We show that a neural network trained on more than 131,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs can predict the locations of aftershocks in an independent test dataset of more than 30,000 mainshock–aftershock pairs more accurately (area under curve of 0.849) than can classic Coulomb failure stress change (area under curve of 0.583). We find that the learned aftershock pattern is physically interpretable: the maximum change in shear stress, the von Mises yield criterion (a scaled version of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress-change tensor) and the sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor each explain more than 98 per cent of the variance in the neural-network prediction. This machine-learning-driven insight provides improved forecasts of aftershock locations and identifies physical quantities that may control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.},

Earthquake prediction, the Grail of Seismology, is, in this context of continuous exciting discoveries, an obvious choice for deep learning exploration. We reviewed the literature of artificial neural network (ANN) applications for earthquake prediction (77 articles, 1994–2019 period) and found two emerging trends: an increasing interest in this domain over time and a complexification of ANN models toward deep learning. Despite the relatively positive results claimed in those studies, we verified that far simpler (and traditional) models seem to offer similar predictive powers, if not better ones. Those include an exponential law for magnitude prediction and a power law (approximated by a logistic regression or one artificial neuron) for aftershock prediction in space. Because of the structured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogs, and the limited number of features so far considered, simpler and more transparent machine‐learning models than ANNs seem preferable at the present stage of research. Those baseline models follow first physical principles and are consistent with the known empirical laws of statistical seismology (e.g., the Gutenberg–Richter law), which are already known to have minimal abilities to predict large earthquakes.},

	abstract = {The present work emphasizes forecasting the occurrence of earth- quakes using a smart and intelligent tool called adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system(ANFIS). ANFIS can be considered as the fusion of artificial neural networking and fuzzy inference system, which is the smarter version of predicting tool. For this purpose information regarding forty-five real earthquakes are collected from different regions. During the period of 1933 and 1985, earth- quakes from different stations are assembled having magnitude not less than 5. Thereupon, two algorithms are used to develop a model with ANFIS, which tries to produce a better prediction of earthquake magnitude. The higher mag- nitude of earthquakes leads to devastating the life and economy, hence for the safety of the vicinity, the prediction of earthquake magnitude can be a life- saving approach which is quite challenging. Adopting this approach is a very fast and economic way of prediction. Out of grid partitioning and subtractive clustering, subtractive clustering is found to be matchless in a prediction of earthquake magnitude for the data selected in this research.},

	abstract = {Earthquake is one of the major natural disasters that not only costs human lives but also leads to financial losses, which affect the country’s economy. Earthquake Prediction is one of the challenging research areas because its early prediction can save a lot of human lives, helps in minimizing the financial losses to some extent. The objective of this research is to develop an earthquake prediction model based on the position and depth by using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. The dataset is split into seven different csv files after thorough processing and a requisition of best-performing regression models is done to compute the results. These algorithms include Random forest (RF) Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The method is applied for different radii around the target. The dataset for this research is taken from the USGS website. The efficiency of algorithms is compared by computing the deviation between actual and predicted outcomes by using the error metrics. The results are evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. Considering the boundary values, the RMSE for RF Regression is 1.731, for MLP regression the value is 1.647 and for SVR the RMSE achieved is 1.720, all for a minimum radius value of 100 and similarly 0.436, 0.428 and 0.449 RMSE is achieved for the respective algorithms on a maximum radius of 5000. The results demonstrate that MLP Regressor is performing better than other algorithms as the error is least in the case of this algorithm.},

	abstract = {A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is presented for predicting the magnitude of the largest earthquake in a pre-defined future time period in a seismic region using eight mathematically computed parameters known as seismicity indicators. The indicators considered are the time elapsed during a particular number (n) of significant seismic events before the month in question, the slope of the Gutenberg–Richter inverse power law curve for the n events, the mean square deviation about the regression line based on the Gutenberg–Richter inverse power law for the n events, the average magnitude of the last n events, the difference between the observed maximum magnitude among the last n events and that expected through the Gutenberg–Richter relationship known as the magnitude deficit, the rate of square root of seismic energy released during the n events, the mean time or period between characteristic events, and the coefficient of variation of the mean time. Prediction accuracies of the model are evaluated using three different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, and the true skill score or R score. The PNN model is trained and tested using data for the Southern California region. The model yields good prediction accuracies for earthquakes of magnitude between 4.5 and 6.0. The PNN model presented in this paper complements the recurrent neural network model developed by the authors previously, where good results were reported for predicting earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6.0.},

	abstract = {Finite-fault source inversions reveal the spatial complexity of earthquake slip over the fault plane. We develop a stochastic characterization of earthquake slip complexity, based on published finite-source rupture models, in which we model the distribution of slip as a spatial random field. The model most consistent with the data follows a von Karman autocorrelation function (ACF) for which the correlation lengths a increase with source dimension. For earthquakes with large fault aspect ratios, we observe substantial differences of the correlation length in the along-strike (ax) and downdip (az) directions. Increasing correlation length with increasing magnitude can be understood using concepts of dynamic rupture propagation. The power spectrum of the slip distribution can also be well described with a power law decay (i.e., a fractal distribution) in which the fractal dimension D remains scale invariant, with a median value D = 2.29 ± 0.23, while the corner wave number kc, which is inversely proportional to source size, decreases with earthquake magnitude, accounting for larger “slip patches” for large-magnitude events. Our stochastic slip model can be used to generate realizations of scenario earthquakes for near-source ground motion simulations.},

The optimal model parameters used for the forecasts are estimated by fitting the model to the observation records up to the starting time of the forecasting period, and the probabilities of earthquake occurrences are obtained through simulations. To tackle the difficulty of heavy computations in fitting a complicated point-process to a huge dataset, an “off-line optimization” and “online forecasting” scheme is proposed to keep both the estimates of model parameters and forecasts updated according to the most recent observations. The results show that the forecasts have captured the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the features of future seismicity. These forecasts are tested against the reference Poisson model that is stationary in time but spatially inhomogeneous.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            In the quest to determine fault weakening processes that govern earthquake mechanics, it is common to infer the earthquake breakdown energy from seismological measurements. Breakdown energy is observed to scale with slip, which is often attributed to enhanced fault weakening with continued slip or at high slip rates, possibly caused by flash heating and thermal pressurization. However, seismologically inferred breakdown energy varies by more than six orders of magnitude and is frequently found to be negative-valued. This casts doubts about the common interpretation that breakdown energy is a proxy for the fracture energy, a material property which must be positive-valued and is generally observed to be relatively scale independent. Here, we present a dynamic model that demonstrates that breakdown energy scaling can occur despite constant fracture energy and does not require thermal pressurization or other enhanced weakening. Instead, earthquake breakdown energy scaling occurs simply due to scale-invariant stress drop overshoot, which may be affected more directly by the overall rupture mode – crack-like or pulse-like – rather than from a specific slip-weakening relationship.},

Breakdown energy is observed to scale with slip, which is often attributed to enhanced fault weakening with continued slip or at high slip rates, possibly caused by flash heating and thermal pressurization. However, seismologically inferred breakdown energy varies by more than six orders of magnitude and is frequently found to be negative-valued. This casts doubts about the common interpretation that breakdown energy is a proxy for the fracture energy, a material property which must be positive-valued and is generally observed to be relatively scale independent. Here, we present a dynamic model that demonstrates that breakdown energy scaling can occur despite constant fracture energy and does not require thermal pressurization or other enhanced weakening. Instead, earthquake breakdown energy scaling occurs simply due to scale-invariant stress drop overshoot, which may be affected more directly by the overall rupture mode – crack-like or pulse-like – rather than from a specific slip-weakening relationship.},

	abstract = {The driving concept behind one of the most successful statistical forecasting models, the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, has been that the seismicity is driven by spontaneously occurring background earthquakes that cascade into multitudes of triggered earthquakes. In nearly all generalizations of the ETAS model, the magnitudes of the background and the triggered earthquakes are assumed to follow Gutenberg-Richter law with the same exponent (β value). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the triggered earthquakes are always assumed to be independent of the magnitude of the triggering earthquake. Using an expectation maximization algorithm applied to the Californian earthquake catalog, we show that the distribution of earthquake magnitudes exhibits three distinct β values: βb for background events and βa − δ and βa + δ, respectively, for triggered events below and above the magnitude of the triggering earthquake; the two last values express a correlation between the magnitudes of triggered events with that of the triggering earthquake, a feature so far absent in all proposed operational generalizations of the ETAS model. The ETAS model incorporating this kinked magnitude distribution provides by far the best description of seismic catalogs and could thus have the best forecasting potential. We speculate that the kinked magnitude distribution may result from the system tending to restore the symmetry of the regional displacement gradient tensor that has been broken by the initiating event. The general emerging concept could be that while the background events occur primarily to accommodate the symmetric stress tensor at the boundaries of the system, the triggered earthquakes are quasi-Goldstone fluctuations of a self-organized critical deformation state.},

This method, based on the application of artificial neural networks, has been used to predict earthquakes in Chile, one of the countries with larger seismic activity. The input values are related to the b-value, the Bath's law, and the Omori-Utsu's law, parameters that are strongly correlated with seismicity, as shown in solid previous works. Two kind of prediction are provided in this study: The probability that an earthquake of magnitude larger than a threshold value happens, and the probability that an earthquake of a limited magnitude interval might occur, both during the next five days in the areas analyzed. For the four Chile's seismic regions examined, with epicenters placed on meshes with dimensions varying from 0.5{\textasciicircum}ox0.5{\textasciicircum}o to 1{\textasciicircum}ox1{\textasciicircum}o, a prototype of neuronal network is presented. The prototypes predict an earthquake every time the probability of an earthquake of magnitude larger than a threshold is sufficiently high. The threshold values have been adjusted with the aim of obtaining as few false positives as possible. The accuracy of the method has been assessed in retrospective experiments by means of statistical tests and compared with well-known machine learning classifiers. The high success rate achieved supports the suitability of applying soft computing in this field and poses new challenges to be addressed.},

	abstract = {The stability and robustness of determining earthquake magnitude are of great significance in earthquake monitoring and seismic hazard assessment. The routine workflow of determining earthquake local magnitude, such as the widely used Richter magnitude, may result in an unreliable measurement of earthquake magnitude because it relies on individual amplitude measurement of a single station, which is prone to be influenced by natural impulsive noise or anthropogenic noise. In this study, we present an automated estimation of earthquake magnitude by applying a deep‐learning algorithm named magnitude neural network (MagNet) based on the full‐waveform recordings from a network of seismic stations at China seismic experimental site (CSES). The MagNet consists of a compression component that extracts the global features of waveform data and an expansion component that yields a Gaussian probability distribution representing the magnitude estimation. The MagNet is trained with an augmented data set, which includes 21,700 training samples with evenly distributed magnitudes. From the prediction results on the test data set, the mean errors and standard deviations are −0.017 and 0.21, respectively, for 600 moderate earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 3 to 5.9, and −0.011 and 0.14, respectively, for 70 small earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 2.3 to 3.5. However, it remains challenging for large earthquakes (magnitude\&gt;6.5), due to the lack of sufficient historical large earthquakes as training data. In addition, testing results show that the new method is capable of minimizing the impact of abnormal noises in the data. These results demonstrate the validity and merits of the proposed deep‐learning method in predicting earthquake magnitude automatically.},

A model in which earthquakes of all sizes have similar rupture initiation can explain the data. This suggests that it is difficult to estimate the eventual size of an earthquake from the initial portion of the waveform. Previously reported curvature seen in the beginning of some velocity waveforms can be largely explained as the effect of anelastic attenuation; thus there is little evidence for a departure from models of simple rupture initiation that grow dynamically from a small region. The results of this study indicate that any “precursory” radiation at seismic frequencies must emanate from a source region no larger than the equivalent of a M0.5 event (i.e. a characteristic length of ∼10 m). The size of the nucleation region for magnitude 0 to 5 earthquakes thus is not resolvable with the standard seismic instrumentation deployed in California.},

	abstract = {To understand whether the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers earthquake changed the proximity to failure on the San Andreas fault system, we examine the general problem of how one earthquake might trigger another. The tendency of rocks to fail in a brittle manner is thought to be a function of both shear and confining stresses, commonly formulated as the Coulomb failure criterion. Here we explore how changes in Coulomb conditions associated with one or more earthquakes may trigger subsequent events. We first consider a Coulomb criterion appropriate for the production of aftershocks, where faults most likely to slip are those optimally orientated for failure as a result of the prevailing regional stress field and the stress change caused by the mainshock. We find that the distribution of aftershocks for the Landers earthquake, as well as for several other moderate events in its vicinity, can be explained by the Coulomb criterion as follows: aftershocks are abundant where the Coulomb stress on optimally orientated faults rose by more than one-half bar, and aftershocks are sparse where the Coulomb stress dropped by a similar amount. Further, we find that several moderate shocks raised the stress at the future Landers epicenter and along much of the Landers rupture zone by about a bar, advancing the Landers shock by 1 to 3 centuries. The Landers rupture, in turn, raised the stress at site of the future M = 6.5 Big Bear aftershock site by 3 bars. The Coulomb stress change on a specified fault is independent of regional stress but depends on the fault geometry, sense of slip, and the coefficient of friction. We use this method to resolve stress changes on the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults imposed by the Landers sequence. Together the Landers and Big Bear earthquakes raised the stress along the San Bernardino segment of the southern San Andreas fault by 2 to 6 bars, hastening the next great earthquake there by about a decade.},

	abstract = {Aftershocks may be triggered by the stresses generated by preceding mainshocks. The temporal frequency and maximum size of aftershocks are well described by the empirical Omori and Bath laws, but spatial patterns are more difficult to forecast. Coulomb failure stress is perhaps the most common criterion invoked to explain spatial distributions of aftershocks. Here we consider the spatial relationship between patterns of aftershocks and a comprehensive list of 38 static elastic scalar metrics of stress (including stress tensor invariants, maximum shear stress, and Coulomb failure stress) from 213 coseismic slip distributions worldwide. The rates of true-positive and false-positive classification of regions with and without aftershocks are assessed with receiver operating characteristic analysis. We infer that the stress metrics that are most consistent with observed aftershock locations are maximum shear stress and the magnitude of the second and third invariants of the stress tensor. These metrics are significantly better than random assignment at a significance level of 0.005 in over 80\% of the slip distributions. In contrast, the widely used Coulomb failure stress criterion is distinguishable from random assignment in only 51–64\% of the slip distributions. These results suggest that a number of alternative scalar metrics are better predictors of aftershock locations than classic Coulomb failure stress change.},

Earthquake prediction, the Grail of Seismology, is, in this context of continuous exciting discoveries, an obvious choice for deep learning exploration. We reviewed the literature of artificial neural network (ANN) applications for earthquake prediction (77 articles, 1994–2019 period) and found two emerging trends: an increasing interest in this domain over time and a complexification of ANN models toward deep learning. Despite the relatively positive results claimed in those studies, we verified that far simpler (and traditional) models seem to offer similar predictive powers, if not better ones. Those include an exponential law for magnitude prediction and a power law (approximated by a logistic regression or one artificial neuron) for aftershock prediction in space. Because of the structured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogs, and the limited number of features so far considered, simpler and more transparent machine‐learning models than ANNs seem preferable at the present stage of research. Those baseline models follow first physical principles and are consistent with the known empirical laws of statistical seismology (e.g., the Gutenberg–Richter law), which are already known to have minimal abilities to predict large earthquakes.},

We show that our model outperforms previous deep-learning and traditional phase-picking and detection algorithms. Applying our model to 5 weeks of continuous data recorded during 2000 Tottori earthquakes in Japan, we were able to detect and locate two times more earthquakes using only a portion (less than 1/3) of seismic stations. Our model picks P and S phases with precision close to manual picks by human analysts; however, its high efficiency and higher sensitivity can result in detecting and characterizing more and smaller events.},

The combination of multiple indicators that have already been successfully used in different seismic zones by the application of feature selection techniques is proposed. These techniques evaluate every input and propose the best combination of them in terms of information gain. Once these sets have been obtained, artificial neural networks are applied to four Chilean zones (the most seismic country in the world) and to two zones of the Iberian Peninsula (a moderate seismicity area). To make the comparison to other models possible, the prediction problem has been turned into one of classification, thus allowing the application of other machine learning classifiers. Comparisons with original sets of inputs and different classifiers are reported to support the degree of success achieved. Statistical tests have also been applied to confirm that the results are significantly different than those of other classifiers. The main novelty of this work stems from the use of feature selection techniques for improving earthquake prediction methods. So, the information gain of different seismic indicators has been determined. Low ranked or null contribution seismic indicators have been removed, optimizing the method. The optimized prediction method proposed has a high performance. Finally, four Chilean zones and two zones of the Iberian Peninsula have been characterized by means of an information gain analysis obtained from different seismic indicators. The results confirm the methodology proposed as the best features in terms of information gain are the same for both regions.},

	abstract = {When a seismometer network records an earthquake, operators will manually review the waveforms and identify the wave phases, a task known as phase picking. Manual phase picking is a time-consuming process that can be automated using machine learning; however, automatic methods have not yet achieved human-level performance, and open-source implementations of state-of-the-art algorithms are not always available. Convolutional networks have revolutionized the field of image processing, where the large amounts of readily available data make possible near-human performance in tasks such as classification and segmentation. Fortunately, phase picking is also an area where thousands of phases are manually picked, which makes convolutional networks a good fit for the processing of this type of data. In this paper, we describe Cospy, an open-source convolutional phase picker that uses a two-stage analysis in which the first stage segments a rough area around the phase, and the second stage regresses the precise location. Our approach was evaluated on the Northern California Earthquake Data Center (NCEDC) data set and, when targeting picks closer than 0.1 s, it achieved an F1-score of 93.13\% for P phases and 91.07\% for S phases. Our results show that convolutional networks are on track to achieve human-level performance on the task of seismic phase picking and can contribute to decreasing the need for manual analysis. An open-source implementation of the proposed approach, pretrained on the NCEDC data set, can be downloaded at https://github.com/stbnps/cospy.},

Prediction has been made on the basis of mathematically calculated eight seismic indicators using the earthquake catalog of the region. These parameters are based on the well-known geophysical facts of Gutenberg–Richter’s inverse law, distribution of characteristic earthquake magnitudes and seismic quiescence. In this research, four machine learning techniques including pattern recognition neural network, recurrent neural network, random forest and linear programming boost ensemble classifier are separately applied to model relationships between calculated seismic parameters and future earthquake occurrences. The problem is formulated as a binary classification task and predictions are made for earthquakes of magnitude greater than or equal to 5.5 (\$\$M {\textbackslash}ge\$\$5.5), for the duration of 1 month. Furthermore, the analysis of earthquake prediction results is carried out for every machine learning classifier in terms of sensitivity, specificity, true and false predictive values. Accuracy is another performance measure considered for analyzing the results. Earthquake magnitude prediction for the Hindukush using these aforementioned techniques show significant and encouraging results, thus constituting a step forward toward the final robust prediction mechanism which is not available so far.},

	abstract = {It is still debated whether earthquake occurrence can be described as a single process or whether foreshocks are different phenomena. If foreshocks behaved differently, this would suggest a change of physical processes in the mainshock preparation phase that would boost hopes of forecasting large earthquakes. Most research on foreshocks focuses on case studies or uses global datasets in which recordings of small earthquakes are incomplete and are thus neglected. We do comprehensive foreshock statistics on all mainshocks in a regional earthquake catalog that is complete above M 2.5. To detect possible differences between foreshocks and seismicity that follows a uniform triggering model (the epidemic‐type aftershock sequence [ETAS] model), we perform a null‐hypothesis test. We also estimate the size of the differences between observed and ETAS‐simulated foreshocks.We define different sets of foreshocks using two different methods, because there is no unique definition: a nearest‐neighbor declustering technique (Zaliapin et al., 2008) and a variety of space–time windows (e.g., Agnew and Jones, 1991). We use data from southern California, northern California, and Italy. For each region, we first search an appropriate null model: an ETAS model that describes aftershock numbers well. In southern California, we find an appropriate spatiotemporal model that is characterized by a large productivity parameter α. After performing a null‐hypothesis test for different mainshock and foreshock magnitudes, we find foreshock signals (p\&lt;0.05) for all mainshocks sizes and independent of the foreshock’s lower magnitude threshold. Observed mainshocks have more foreshocks than the ETAS model predicts.},

It helps network with a limited number of training data to estimation. It is common for earthquakes modeling by data-driven methods in this case. In addition, the proposed method is combined with Rosenberg cluster method to remove aftershocks events from the history of catalog for NN to better process the data. The results show that created RBF model successfully estimates the interevent times between large and sequence earthquakes that can be used as a tool to predict earthquake, so that comparison with other NN structure, for example Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) NN, reveals the superiority of the proposed method. Because of superiority proposed method has higher accuracy, lower costs and simpler network structure.},

	abstract = {Tectonic faults fail in a spectrum of modes, ranging from earthquakes to slow slip events. The physics of fast earthquakes are well described by stick–slip friction and elastodynamic rupture; however, slow earthquakes are poorly understood. Key questions remain about how ruptures propagate quasi-dynamically, whether they obey different scaling laws from ordinary earthquakes and whether a single fault can host multiple slip modes. We report on laboratory earthquakes and show that both slow and fast slip modes are preceded by a cascade of micro-failure events that radiate elastic energy in a manner that foretells catastrophic failure. Using machine learning, we find that acoustic emissions generated during shear of quartz fault gouge under normal stress of 1–10 MPa predict the timing and duration of laboratory earthquakes. Laboratory slow earthquakes reach peak slip velocities of the order of 1 × 10−4 m s−1 and do not radiate high-frequency elastic energy, consistent with tectonic slow slip. Acoustic signals generated in the early stages of impending fast laboratory earthquakes are systematically larger than those for slow slip events. Here, we show that a broad range of stick–slip and creep–slip modes of failure can be predicted and share common mechanisms, which suggests that catastrophic earthquake failure may be preceded by an organized, potentially forecastable, set of processes.},

	abstract = {Earthquake prediction is a very important problem in seismology, the success of which can potentially save many human lives. Various kinds of technologies have been proposed to address this problem, such as mathematical analysis, machine learning algorithms like decision trees and support vector machines, and precursors signal study. Unfortunately, they usually do not have very good results due to the seemingly dynamic and unpredictable nature of earthquakes. In contrast, we notice that earthquakes are spatially and temporally correlated because of the crust movement. Therefore, earthquake prediction for a particular location should not be conducted only based on the history data in that location, but according to the history data in a larger area. In this paper, we employ a deep learning technique called long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the spatio-temporal relationship among earthquakes in different locations and make predictions by taking advantage of that relationship. Simulation results show that the LSTM network with two-dimensional input developed in this paper is able to discover and exploit the spatio-temporal correlations among earthquakes to make better predictions than before.},

	abstract = {Large-scale regular vegetation patterns are common in nature, but their causes are disputed. Whereas recent theory focuses on scale-dependent feedbacks as a potentially universal mechanism, earlier studies suggest that many regular spatial patterns result from territorial interference competition between colonies of social-insect ecosystem engineers, leading to hexagonally overdispersed nest sites and associated vegetation. Evidence for this latter mechanism is scattered throughout decades of disparate literature and lacks a unified conceptual framework, fueling skepticism about its generality in debates over the origins of patterned landscapes. We review these mechanisms and debates, finding evidence that spotted and gapped vegetation patterns generated by ants, termites, and other subterranean animals are globally widespread, locally important for ecosystem functioning, and consistent with models of intraspecific territoriality. Because these and other mechanisms of regular-pattern formation are not mutually exclusive and can coexist and interact at different scales, the prevailing theoretical outlook on spatial self-organization in ecology must expand to incorporate the dynamic interplay of multiple processes.},

	abstract = {The origin of regular spatial patterns in ecological systems has long fascinated researchers. Turing’s activator–inhibitor principle is considered the central paradigm to explain such patterns. According to this principle, local activation combined with long-range inhibition of growth and survival is an essential prerequisite for pattern formation. Here, we show that the physical principle of phase separation, solely based on density-dependent movement by organisms, represents an alternative class of self-organized pattern formation in ecology. Using experiments with self-organizing mussel beds, we derive an empirical relation between the speed of animal movement and local animal density. By incorporating this relation in a partial differential equation, we demonstrate that this model corresponds mathematically to the well-known Cahn–Hilliard equation for phase separation in physics. Finally, we show that the predicted patterns match those found both in field observations and in our experiments. Our results reveal a principle for ecological self-organization, where phase separation rather than activation and inhibition processes drives spatial pattern formation.},

Two different methods are explored. In the first method, a large seismic region is subdivided into several small subregions and the temporal historical earthquake record is divided into a number of small equal time periods. Seismicity indicators are computed for each subregion for each time period and their relationship to the magnitude of the largest earthquake occurring in that subregion during the following time-period is studied using a recurrent neural network. In the second more direct approach, the temporal historical earthquake record is divided into a number of unequal time periods where each period is defined as the time between large earthquakes. Seismicity indicators are computed for each time-period and their relationship to the latitude and longitude of the epicentral location, and time of occurrence of the following major earthquake is studied using a recurrent neural network.},

Possible mechanisms include oscillating consumer–resource interactions, localized disturbance-recovery processes and scale-dependent feedback. Despite abundant theoretical literature, studies revealing spatial self-organization in real ecosystems are limited. Recently, however, many examples of regular pattern formation have been discovered, supporting the importance of scale-dependent feedback. Here, we review these studies, showing regular pattern formation to be a general phenomenon rather than a peculiarity. We provide a conceptual framework explaining how scale-dependent feedback determines regular pattern formation in ecosystems. More empirical studies are needed to better understand regular pattern formation in ecosystems, and how this affects the response of ecosystems to global environmental change.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental feature of earthquakes that impacts basic and applied analyses of seismicity. Events included in the existing short‐duration instrumental catalogs are concentrated strongly within a very small fraction of the space–time volume, which is highly amplified by activity associated with the largest recorded events. The earthquakes that are included in instrumental catalogs are unlikely to be fully representative of the long‐term behavior of regional seismicity. We illustrate this and other aspects of space–time earthquake clustering, and propose a quantitative clustering measure based on the receiver operating characteristic diagram. The proposed approach allows eliminating effects of marginal space and time inhomogeneities related to the geometry of the fault network and regionwide changes in earthquake rates, and quantifying coupled space–time variations that include aftershocks, swarms, and other forms of clusters. The proposed measure is used to quantify and compare earthquake clustering in southern California, western United States, central and eastern United States, Alaska, Japan, and epidemic‐type aftershock sequence model results. All examined cases show a high degree of coupled space–time clustering, with the marginal space clustering dominating the marginal time clustering. Declustering earthquake catalogs can help clarify long‐term aspects of regional seismicity and increase the signal‐to‐noise ratio of effects that are subtler than the strong clustering signatures. We illustrate how the high coupled space–time clustering can be decreased or removed using a data‐adaptive parsimonious nearest‐neighbor declustering approach, and emphasize basic unresolved issues on the proper outcome and quality metrics of declustering. At present, declustering remains an exploratory tool, rather than a rigorous optimization problem, and selecting an appropriate declustering method should depend on the data and problem at hand.},

In the model cells can move, proliferate, and experience cell-cell adhesion. In this work we focus on a continuum description of this phenomenon by means of a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation (GCH) with a proliferation term. As in the discrete model, there are two interesting regimes. For subcritical adhesion, there are propagating “pulled” fronts, similar to those of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation. The problem of front velocity selection is examined, and our theoretical predictions are in the good agreement with a numerical solution of the GCH equation. For supercritical adhesion, there is a nontrivial transient behavior, where density profile exhibits a secondary peak. To analyze this regime, we investigated relaxation dynamics for the Cahn-Hilliard equation without proliferation. We found that the relaxation process exhibits self-similar behavior. The results of continuum and discrete models are in good agreement with each other for the different regimes we analyzed.},

	abstract = {Seismology is a data rich and data-driven science. Application of machine learning for gaining new insights from seismic data is a rapidly evolving sub-field of seismology. The availability of a large amount of seismic data and computational resources, together with the development of advanced techniques can foster more robust models and algorithms to process and analyze seismic signals. Known examples or labeled data sets, are the essential requisite for building supervised models. Seismology has labeled data, but the reliability of those labels is highly variable, and the lack of high-quality labeled data sets to serve as ground truth as well as the lack of standard benchmarks are obstacles to more rapid progress. In this paper we present a high-quality, large-scale, and global data set of local earthquake and non-earthquake signals recorded by seismic instruments. The data set in its current state contains two categories: (1) local earthquake waveforms (recorded at “local” distances within 350 km of earthquakes) and (2) seismic noise waveforms that are free of earthquake signals. Together these data comprise 1.2 million time series or more than 19,000 hours of seismic signal recordings. Constructing such a large-scale database with reliable labels is a challenging task. Here, we present the properties of the data set, describe the data collection, quality control procedures, and processing steps we undertook to insure accurate labeling, and discuss potential applications. We hope that the scale and accuracy of STEAD presents new and unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the seismological community and beyond.},

to \&gt;11 000 earthquakes with local magnitudes

Moment magnitude Mw values, derived from the spectra

distribution with a larger b-value (1.22) from that associated
with the ML values (0.93) for the same earthquakes.
The completeness magnitude for the Mw values is 1.6
while for ML it is 1.0. The quantity
(Mw − ML) linearly
increases in the analysed magnitude range as ML decreases. An average earthquake with ML = 0 in the
study area has an Mw of about 0.9. The developed

So far, scientists can only offer empirical evidence from statistical compilations of past sequences, arguing that normally the aftershock sequence will decay gradually whereas the occurrence of a forthcoming larger event has a probability of a few per cent. Here we analyse the average size distribution of aftershocks of the recent Amatrice–Norcia and Kumamoto earthquake sequences, and we suggest that in many cases it may be possible to discriminate whether an ongoing sequence represents a decaying aftershock sequence or foreshocks to an upcoming large event. We propose a simple traffic light classification to assess in real time the level of concern about a subsequent larger event and test it against 58 sequences, achieving a classification accuracy of 95 per cent.},

We show that a relationship of the form , with d the distance to the kth nearest seismic station, fits the observations well, k depending on the minimum number of stations being required to trigger an event declaration in a catalog. We then propose a new Mc mapping approach, the Bayesian magnitude of completeness (BMC) method, based on a two-step procedure: (1) a spatial resolution optimization to minimize spatial heterogeneities and uncertainties in Mc estimates and (2) a Bayesian approach that merges prior information about Mc based on the proximity to seismic stations with locally observed values weighted by their respective uncertainties. Contrary to the current Mc mapping procedures, the radius that defines which earthquakes to include in the local magnitude distribution is chosen according to an objective criterion, and there are no gaps in the spatial estimation of Mc. The method solely requires the coordinates of seismic stations. Here, we investigate the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) seismic network and earthquake catalog over the period 1994–2010.},

To compete, time-dependent seismicity models are calibrated on earthquake catalog data. However, catalogs contain much observational uncertainty. We study the impact of magnitude uncertainties on rate estimates in clustering models, on their forecasts and on their evaluation by CSEP's consistency tests. First, we quantify magnitude uncertainties. We find that magnitude uncertainty is more heavy-tailed than a Gaussian, such as a double-sided exponential distribution, with scale parameter νc = 0.1 – 0.3. Second, we study the impact of such noise on the forecasts of a simple clustering model which captures the main ingredients of popular short term models. We prove that the deviations of noisy forecasts from an exact forecast are power law distributed in the tail with exponent α = (aνc)−1, where a is the exponent of the productivity law of aftershocks. We further prove that the typical scale of the fluctuations remains sensitively dependent on the specific catalog. Third, we study how noisy forecasts are evaluated in CSEP consistency tests. Noisy forecasts are rejected more frequently than expected for a given confidence limit because the Poisson assumption of the consistency tests is inadequate for short-term forecast evaluations. To capture the idiosyncrasies of each model together with any propagating uncertainties, the forecasts need to specify the entire likelihood distribution of seismic rates.},

Traditional approaches to characterizing geometrical attributes of seismicity rely on assumed locations and geometry of fault surfaces, particularly at depth, where resolution is overall quite poor. In this study, we develop an alternative approach to quantifying geometrical properties of seismicity using techniques from anisotropic point process theory. Our approach does not require prior knowledge about the underlying fault properties. We characterize the geometrical attributes of 32 distinct seismicity regions in California and introduce a simple four class classification scheme that covers the range of geometrical properties observed. Most of the regions classified as having localized seismicity are within northern California, while nearly all of the regions classified as having distributed seismicity are within southern California. In addition, we find that roughly 1 out of 4 regions exhibit orthogonal seismicity structures. The results of this study provide a foundation for future analyses of geometrical properties of seismicity and new observables to compare with numerical modelling studies.},

	abstract = {The 2016–2017 Central Apennines earthquake sequence is a recent example of how damages from subsequent aftershocks can exceed those caused by the initial mainshock. Recent studies reveal that physics-based aftershock forecasts present comparable skills to their statistical counterparts, but their performance remains a controversial subject. Here we employ physics-based models that combine the elasto-static stress transfer with rate-and-state friction laws, and short-term statistical Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) models to describe the spatiotemporal evolution of the earthquake cascade. We then track the absolute and relative model performance using log-likelihood statistics for a 1-year horizon after the 24 August 2016 Mw = 6.0 Amatrice earthquake. We perform a series of pseudoprospective experiments by producing seven classes of Coulomb rate-state (CRS) forecasts with gradual increase in data input quality and model complexity. Our goal is to investigate the influence of data quality on the predictive power of physics-based models and to assess the comparative performance of the forecasts in critical time windows, such as the period following the 26 October Visso earthquakes leading to the 30 October Mw = 6.5 Norcia mainshock. We find that (1) the spatiotemporal performance of the basic CRS models is poor and progressively improves as more refined data are used, (2) CRS forecasts are about as informative as ETAS when secondary triggering effects from M3+ earthquakes are included together with spatially variable slip models, spatially heterogeneous receiver faults, and optimized rate-and-state parameters. After the Visso earthquakes, the more elaborate CRS model outperforms ETAS highlighting the importance of the static stress transfer for operational earthquake forecasting.},

	abstract = {10 M ≥ 6.7 earthquakes ruptured 1000 km of the North Anatolian fault (Turkey) during 1939–1992, providing an unsurpassed opportunity to study how one large shock sets up the next. We use the mapped surface slip and fault geometry to infer the transfer of stress throughout the sequence. Calculations of the change in Coulomb failure stress reveal that nine out of 10 ruptures were brought closer to failure by the preceding shocks, typically by 1–10 bar, equivalent to 3–30 years of secular stressing. We translate the calculated stress changes into earthquake probability gains using an earthquake-nucleation constitutive relation, which includes both permanent and transient effects of the sudden stress changes. The transient effects of the stress changes dominate during the mean 10 yr period between triggering and subsequent rupturing shocks in the Anatolia sequence. The stress changes result in an average three-fold gain in the net earthquake probability during the decade after each event. Stress is calculated to be high today at several isolated sites along the fault. During the next 30 years, we estimate a 15 per cent probability of a M ≥ 6.7 earthquake east of the major eastern centre of Ercinzan, and a 12 per cent probability for a large event south of the major western port city of Izmit. Such stress-based probability calculations may thus be useful to assess and update earthquake hazards elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Since the beginning of the 1980s, when Mandelbrot observed that earthquakes occur on ‘fractal’ self-similar sets, many studies have investigated the dynamical mechanisms that lead to self-similarities in the earthquake process. Interpreting seismicity as a self-similar process is undoubtedly convenient to bypass the physical complexities related to the actual process. Self-similar processes are indeed invariant under suitable scaling of space and time. In this study, we show that long-range dependence is an inherent feature of the seismic process, and is universal. Examination of series of cumulative seismic moment both in Italy and worldwide through Hurst’s rescaled range analysis shows that seismicity is a memory process with a Hurst exponent H ≈ 0.87. We observe that H is substantially space- and time-invariant, except in cases of catalog incompleteness. This has implications for earthquake forecasting. Hence, we have developed a probability model for earthquake occurrence that allows for long-range dependence in the seismic process. Unlike the Poisson model, dependent events are allowed. This model can be easily transferred to other disciplines that deal with self-similar processes.},

Stress interactions among them are comprehensively investigated by applying the ETAS (Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence) model and calculating (Coulomb failure stress change) from a 3D linear viscoelastic mode. The combined (coseismic plus postseismic) induced by proceeding Yutian earthquakes on hypocenters of the 2012, 2014, and 2020 Yutian earthquakes are −1.5 × 10−4, 3.6 × 10−3, and 1.5 × 10−1 MPa, respectively.

	abstract = {The Kobe earthquake struck at the edge of the densely populated Osaka-Kyoto corridor in southwest Japan. We investigate how the earthquake transferred stress to nearby faults, altering their proximity to failure and thus changing earthquake probabilities. We find that relative to the pre-Kobe seismicity, Kobe aftershocks were concentrated in regions of calculated Coulomb stress increase and less common in regions of stress decrease. We quantify this relationship by forming the spatial correlation between the seismicity rate change and the Coulomb stress change. The correlation is significant for stress changes greater than 0.2–1.0 bars (0.02–0.1 MPa), and the nonlinear dependence of seismicity rate change on stress change is compatible with a state- and rate-dependent formulation for earthquake occurrence. We extend this analysis to future mainshocks by resolving the stress changes on major faults within 100 km of Kobe and calculating the change in probability caused by these stress changes. Transient effects of the stress changes are incorporated by the state-dependent constitutive relation, which amplifies the permanent stress changes during the aftershock period. Earthquake probability framed in this manner is highly time-dependent, much more so than is assumed in current practice. Because the probabilities depend on several poorly known parameters of the major faults, we estimate uncertainties of the probabilities by Monte Carlo simulation. This enables us to include uncertainties on the elapsed time since the last earthquake, the repeat time and its variability, and the period of aftershock decay. We estimate that a calculated 3-bar (0.3-MPa) stress increase on the eastern section of the Arima-Takatsuki Tectonic Line (ATTL) near Kyoto causes fivefold increase in the 30-year probability of a subsequent large earthquake near Kyoto; a 2-bar (0.2-MPa) stress decrease on the western section of the ATTL results in a reduction in probability by a factor of 140 to 2000. The probability of a Mw = 6.9 earthquake within 50 km of Osaka during 1997–2007 is estimated to have risen from 5–6\% before the Kobe earthquake to 7–11\% afterward; during 1997–2027, it is estimated to have risen from 14–16\% before Kobe to 16–22\%.},

	abstract = {Despite decades of observational, laboratory and theoretical studies, the processes leading to large earthquake generation remain enigmatic. However, recent observations provide new promising perspectives that advance knowledge. Here, we review data on the initiation processes of large earthquakes and show that they are multiscale and diverse, involving localization of deformation, fault heterogeneities and variable local loading rate effects. Analyses of seismic and geodetic data reveal evidence for regional weakening by earthquake-induced rock damage and progressive localization of deformation around the eventual rupture zones a few years before some large earthquakes. The final phase of deformation localization includes, depending on conditions, a mixture of slow slip transients and foreshocks at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The evolution of slip on large, localized faults shows a step-like increase that might reflect stress loading by previous failures, which can produce larger dynamic slip, in contrast to the smooth acceleration expected for a growing aseismic nucleation phase. We propose an integrated model to explain the diversity of large earthquake generation from progressive volumetric deformation to localized slip, which motivates future near-fault seismic and geodetic studies with dense sensor networks and improved analysis techniques that can resolve multiscale processes.},

For this purpose, a recently developed version of the ETAS model, incorporating a three-dimensional spatial triggering kernel, has been adopted. Our analysis has been carried out representing the b-value and the probability of independence of events on six vertical cross-sections suitably related to the seismic structures that are considered responsible of the seismicity observed in the study area.The results of the statistical analysis of the seismicity in the study area have shown a clear distinction between the western normal low-angle fault system, characterized by eastward dip, and the eastern normal fault systems, with westward dip. In the former (Etrurian Fault System; EFS) we found seismicity with a high b-value and high probability of independence, i.e., a scarce capacity of producing clusters and strong aftershock sequences. The eastern fault systems of our study area are distinguishable in two main distinct systems, which generated two strong seismic sequences in 1997 and 2016-2017. In the former (Colfiorito) sequence the seismicity showed a very low b-value and a modest probability of independence, while in the latter (Central Italy) sequence the b-value was significantly higher and the probability of independence had extremely low values (manifesting a high level of clustering). The much higher b-value of the EFS than the other extensional sources could be caused by its peculiar seismotectonic role of discontinuity at the base of the normal active faulting, and its reduced capacity of accumulating stress. This circumstance may be interpreted by a difference in the rheological properties of these fault systems, possibly also in relation to their present status in the earthquake cycle and the presence of strong aftershock sequences.},

	abstract = {Differential rotation of Earth’s inner core relative to the mantle is thought to occur under the effects of the geodynamo on core dynamics and gravitational core–mantle coupling. This rotation has been inferred from temporal changes between repeated seismic waves that should traverse the same path through the inner core. Here we analyse repeated seismic waves from the early 1990s and show that all of the paths that previously showed significant temporal changes have exhibited little change over the past decade. This globally consistent pattern suggests that inner-core rotation has recently paused. We compared this recent pattern to the Alaskan seismic records of South Sandwich Islands doublets going back to 1964 and it seems to be associated with a gradual turning-back of the inner core as a part of an approximately seven-decade oscillation, with another turning point in the early 1970s. This multidecadal periodicity coincides with changes in several other geophysical observations, especially the length of day and magnetic field. These observations provide evidence for dynamic interactions between the Earth’s layers, from the deepest interior to the surface, potentially due to gravitational coupling and the exchange of angular momentum from the core and mantle to the surface.},

Finally, we apply the procedure to a new Italian instrumental earthquake catalog from 1960 to 2019 to investigate the b‐value spatial variability over the Italian territory.},

	abstract = {Earthquakes caused by human activities receive scrutiny due to the risks and hazards they pose. Seismicity that occurs after the causative anthropogenic operation stops has been particularly problematic—both because of high-profile cases of damage caused by this trailing seismicity and due to the loss of control for risk management. With this motivation, we undertake a statistical examination of how induced seismicity stops. We borrow the concept of Båth’s law from tectonic aftershock sequences. Båth’s law anticipates the difference between magnitudes in two subsets of seismicity as dependent on their population count ratio. We test this concept for its applicability to induced seismicity, including {\textasciitilde} 80 cases of earthquakes caused by hydraulic fracturing, enhanced geothermal systems, and other fluid-injections with clear operational end points. We find that induced seismicity obeys Båth’s law: both in terms of the magnitude-count-ratio relationship and the power law distribution of residuals. Furthermore, the distribution of count ratios is skewed and heavy-tailed, with most earthquakes occurring during stimulation/injection. We discuss potential models to improve the characterization of these count ratios and propose a Seismogenic Fault Injection Test to measure their parameters in situ. We conclude that Båth’s law quantifies the occurrence of earthquake magnitudes trailing anthropogenic operations.},

For this purpose, a recently developed version of the ETAS model, incorporating a three-dimensional spatial triggering kernel, has been adopted. Our analysis has been carried out representing the b-value and the probability of independence of events on six vertical cross-sections suitably related to the seismic structures that are considered responsible of the seismicity observed in the study area.The results of the statistical analysis of the seismicity in the study area have shown a clear distinction between the western normal low-angle fault system, characterized by eastward dip, and the eastern normal fault systems, with westward dip. In the former (Etrurian Fault System; EFS) we found seismicity with a high b-value and high probability of independence, i.e., a scarce capacity of producing clusters and strong aftershock sequences. The eastern fault systems of our study area are distinguishable in two main distinct systems, which generated two strong seismic sequences in 1997 and 2016-2017. In the former (Colfiorito) sequence the seismicity showed a very low b-value and a modest probability of independence, while in the latter (Central Italy) sequence the b-value was significantly higher and the probability of independence had extremely low values (manifesting a high level of clustering). The much higher b-value of the EFS than the other extensional sources could be caused by its peculiar seismotectonic role of discontinuity at the base of the normal active faulting, and its reduced capacity of accumulating stress. This circumstance may be interpreted by a difference in the rheological properties of these fault systems, possibly also in relation to their present status in the earthquake cycle and the presence of strong aftershock sequences.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we carry out a comparison analysis of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model for the earthquake process, embedded with the three main exponential-type distributions adopted in practical applications to describe the magnitudes of seismic events, that are, the Gutenberg–Richter (GR), the tapered Gutenberg–Richter (TGR) and the CHaracteristic (CH) frequency–magnitude distributions (FMDs). The first law is a pure-power decreasing function, while both the other two introduce a more rapid decay in the tail of the distribution: a soft taper in the TGR model and a sharp cut-off in the CH one. To perform the comparison, we first investigate some theoretical features of the ETAS model with CH-distributed magnitudes (ETAS-CH), which have not been deeply analysed in the literature as much as for ETAS-TGR and ETAS-GR. In particular, we explicitly compute the branching ratio, we analyse its asymptotics in relation to its parameters, and we derive the proper stability conditions. We then move to the comparison among the three ETAS-GR, ETAS-TGR and ETAS-CH processes, to highlight differences and similarities. This is done by carrying out both a theoretical analysis, mainly focused on the three models’ branching ratios and the relative sensitivity, and a simulation analysis of realistic synthetic catalogues to compare the processes’ numbers, events’ magnitude distribution and temporal evolution. The results we obtained show that the ETAS-TGR and ETAS-CH processes have very similar features. They both have also less restrictive non-explosion conditions than for ETAS-GR; in fact, differently from this latter case, their branching ratios exist for any value of the parameters and are lower than the one of ETAS-GR, to which they converge for large magnitudes.},

We then propose a new Mc mapping approach, the Bayesian magnitude of completeness (BMC) method, based on a two-step procedure: (1) a spatial resolution optimization to minimize spatial heterogeneities and uncertainties in Mc estimates and (2) a Bayesian approach that merges prior information about Mc based on the proximity to seismic stations with locally observed values weighted by their respective uncertainties. Contrary to the current Mc mapping procedures, the radius that defines which earthquakes to include in the local magnitude distribution is chosen according to an objective criterion, and there are no gaps in the spatial estimation of Mc. The method solely requires the coordinates of seismic stations. Here, we investigate the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau (CWB) seismic network and earthquake catalog over the period 1994–2010.},

Our method models the entire magnitude range (emr method) consisting of the self-similar complete part of the frequency-magnitude distribution and the incomplete portion, thus providing a comprehensive seismicity model. We compare the emr method with three existing techniques, finding that emr shows a superior performance when applied to synthetic test cases or real data from regional and global earthquake catalogues. This method, however, is also the most computationally intensive. Accurate knowledge of Mc is essential for many seismicity-based studies, and particularly for mapping out seismicity parameters such as the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. By explicitly computing the uncertainties in Mc using a bootstrap approach, we show that uncertainties in b-values are larger than traditionally assumed, especially when considering small sample sizes.As examples, we investigated temporal variations of Mc for the 1992 Landers aftershock sequence and found that it was underestimated on average by 0.2 with former techniques. Mapping Mc on a global scale, Mc reveals considerable spatial variations for the Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) (5.3 ≤ Mc ≤ 6.0) and the International Seismological Centre (isc) catalogue (4.3 ≤ Mc ≤ 5.0).},

Mc was estimated based on its departure from the linear frequency-magnitude relation of the 250 closest earthquakes to grid nodes, spaced 10 km apart. In all catalogs studied, Mc was strongly heterogeneous. In offshore areas the Mc was typically one unit of magnitude higher than onshore. On land also, Mc can vary by one order of magnitude over distance less than 50 km. We recommend that seismicity studies that depend on complete sets of small earthquakes should be limited to areas with similar Mc, or the minimum magnitude for the analysis has to be raised to the highest common value of Mc. We believe that the data quality, as reflected by the Mc level, should be used to define the spatial extent of seismicity studies where Mc plays a role. The method we use calculates the goodness of fit between a power law fit to the data and the observed frequency-magnitude distribution as a function of a lower cutoff of the magnitude data. Mc is defined as the magnitude at which 90\% of the data can be modeled by a power law fit. Mc in the 1990s is approximately 1.2 ± 0.4 in most parts of California, 1.8 ± 0.4 in most of Alaska (Aleutians and Panhandle excluded), and at a higher level in the JUNEC catalog for Japan. Various sources, such as explosions and earthquake families beneath volcanoes, can lead to distributions that cannot be fit well by power laws. For the Hokkaido region we demonstrate how neglecting the spatial variability of Mc can lead to erroneous assumptions about deviations from self-similarity of earthquake scaling.},

This self-exciting nature of seismicity generates complex clustering of earthquakes in space and time.

We address this problem by developing a methodology to compute the probabilities for such extreme earthquakes to be above certain magnitudes. We combine the Bayesian methods with the extreme value theory and assume that the occurrence of earthquakes can be described by the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence process. We analyze in detail the application of this methodology to the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake sequence. We are able to estimate retrospectively the probabilities of having large subsequent earthquakes during several stages of the evolution of this sequence.},

	abstract = {The most common earthquake forecasting models assume that the magnitude of the next earthquake is independent from the past. This feature severely limits the capability to forecast large earthquakes with high probabilities. Here we investigate empirically on the magnitude-independence assumption, exploring if: (i) background and triggered earthquakes have the same frequency–magnitude distribution, (ii) variations of seismicity in the space–time–magnitude domain encode some information on the future earthquakes size. For this purpose, and to verify the stability of the findings, we consider seismic catalogues covering different space–time–magnitude windows, such as the Alto Tiberina Near Fault Observatory (TABOO), the California and Japanese seismic catalogues. Our approach is inspired by the nearest-neighbour method proposed by Baiesi \&amp; Paczuski and elaborated by Zaliapin et al. to distinguish between triggered and background earthquakes. Here we implement the same metric-based correlation to identify the precursory seismicity of any triggered earthquake; this allows us to analyse, for each triggered earthquake, the space–time–magnitude distribution of the seismicity that likely contributed to its occurrence. Our results show that the magnitude-independence assumption holds reasonably well in all catalogues, with a remarkable exception that is consistent with a previous independent study; this departure from the magnitude-independence assumption shows that larger events tend to nucleate at a higher distance from the ongoing sequence. We also notice that the reliability of this assumption may depend on the spatial scale considered; it holds for seismic catalogues of large areas, but we identify possible departures in small areas, reflecting different ways to release locally seismic energy. Finally, we come across an important issue that may lead to misleading results in similar studies, that is, if a seismic catalogue appears overall complete above a fixed magnitude threshold, it may still yield spurious signals into the analysis. Specifically, we show that some significant departures from the magnitude-independence assumption do not survive when considering spatiotemporal variations of the magnitude of completeness.},

It was subsequently argued that this conclusion was not supported by the original earthquake data from California. One of the main challenges is the lack of completeness of earthquake catalogs. Here, we study an aftershock sequence of nano- and picoseismicity as observed at the Mponeng mine, for which the issue of incompleteness is much less pronounced.

	abstract = {Despite decades of observational, laboratory and theoretical studies, the processes leading to large earthquake generation remain enigmatic. However, recent observations provide new promising perspectives that advance knowledge. Here, we review data on the initiation processes of large earthquakes and show that they are multiscale and diverse, involving localization of deformation, fault heterogeneities and variable local loading rate effects. Analyses of seismic and geodetic data reveal evidence for regional weakening by earthquake-induced rock damage and progressive localization of deformation around the eventual rupture zones a few years before some large earthquakes. The final phase of deformation localization includes, depending on conditions, a mixture of slow slip transients and foreshocks at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The evolution of slip on large, localized faults shows a step-like increase that might reflect stress loading by previous failures, which can produce larger dynamic slip, in contrast to the smooth acceleration expected for a growing aseismic nucleation phase. We propose an integrated model to explain the diversity of large earthquake generation from progressive volumetric deformation to localized slip, which motivates future near-fault seismic and geodetic studies with dense sensor networks and improved analysis techniques that can resolve multiscale processes.},

Indeed, while clustering in time and space is widely accepted, much more questionable is the existence of magnitude correlations. The standard approach generally assumes that magnitudes are independent and therefore in principle unpredictable. Here we show the existence of clustering in magnitude: earthquakes occur with higher probability close in time, space, and magnitude to previous events. More precisely, the next earthquake tends to have a magnitude similar but smaller than the previous one. A dynamical scaling relation between magnitude, time, and space distances reproduces the complex pattern of magnitude, spatial, and temporal correlations observed in experimental seismic catalogs.},

For illustration, a retrospective forecasting experiment is carried out to forecast the seismicity in the Japan region before and after the Tokachi-Oki earthquake (M 8.0) at 19:50:07 (UTC) on 25 September 2003, in the format of contour images. The optimal model parameters used for the forecasts are estimated by fitting the model to the observation records up to the starting time of the forecasting period, and the probabilities of earthquake occurrences are obtained through simulations. To tackle the difficulty of heavy computations in fitting a complicated point-process to a huge dataset, an “off-line optimization” and “online forecasting” scheme is proposed to keep both the estimates of model parameters and forecasts updated according to the most recent observations. The results show that the forecasts have captured the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of the features of future seismicity. These forecasts are tested against the reference Poisson model that is stationary in time but spatially inhomogeneous.},

              et al.
              looked at this energy release for more than 100 large earthquakes. Although the overall size of an earthquake cannot be predicted from the rate of energy release, a minimum size can be estimated.

              The largest observed earthquakes occur on subduction interfaces and frequently cause widespread damage and loss of life. Understanding the rupture behavior of megathrust events is crucial for earthquake rupture physics, as well as for earthquake early-warning systems. However, the large variability in behavior between individual events seemingly defies a description with a simple unifying model. Here we use three source time function (STF) data sets for subduction zone earthquakes, with moment magnitude
              M
              w
              ≥ 7, and show that such large ruptures share a typical universal behavior. The median STF is scalable between events with different sizes, grows linearly, and is nearly triangular. The deviations from the median behavior are multiplicative and Gaussian—that is, they are proportionally larger for larger events. Our observations suggest that earthquake magnitudes cannot be predicted from the characteristics of rupture onsets.},

Despite this relative simplicity, the observational basis for rupture onsets is unclear. Numerous reports of evidence for magnitude-dependent rupture onsets (which imply deterministic rupture behavior) stand in contradiction to a large body of physics-based rupture modeling efforts, which are mostly based on inherently nondeterministic principles. Here we make use of the abundance of short-distance recordings available today; a magnitude dependency of onsets should appear most prominently in such recordings. We use a simple method to demonstrate that all ruptures in the studied magnitude range (4 {\textless} M {\textless} 8) share a universal initial rupture behavior and discuss ensuing implications for physical rupture processes and earthquake early warning.},

Olson and Allen now suggest that processes during earthquake initiation do control the final magnitude to some degree. They find a scaling relation between the frequency content of energy radiated in the first few seconds of rupture and earthquake magnitude.

Here we show that the evolution of P-wave peak displacement with time is informative regarding the early stage of the rupture process and can be used as a proxy for the final size of the rupture. For the analysed earthquake set, we found a rapid initial increase of the peak displacement for small events and a slower growth for large earthquakes.

Specifically, we test the hypothesis that tectonic earthquakes usually show clustering only as a result of an initial earthquake triggering subsequent ones and that the magnitude of each triggered earthquake is entirely independent of the magnitude of the triggering earthquake. Therefore a certain percentage of the time, as determined by the Gutenberg–Richter magnitude–frequency relationship, an earthquake should by chance be larger than or comparable in size to the earthquake that triggered it. This hypothesis predicts that the number of times foreshocks or multiplets are observed should be a fixed fraction of the number of aftershock observations. We find that this is indeed the case in the global CMT and NEIC catalogs; the average ratios between foreshock, aftershock, and multiplet rates are consistent with what would be predicted by the Gutenberg–Richter relationship with b = 1. We give special attention to the Solomon Islands, where it has been claimed that unique fault structures lead to unusually high numbers of multiplets. We use Monte Carlo trials to demonstrate that the Solomon Islands multiplets may be explained simply by a high regional aftershock rate and earthquake density. We also verify our foreshock results from the more complete recordings of small earthquakes available in the California catalog and find that foreshock rates for a wide range of foreshock and mainshock magnitudes can be projected from aftershock rates using the Gutenberg–Richter relationship with b = 1 and the relationship that the number of earthquakes triggered varies with triggering earthquake magnitude M as c10αM, where c is a productivity constant and α is equal to 1. Finally, we test an alternative model that proposes that foreshocks do not trigger their mainshocks but are instead triggered by the mainshock nucleation phase. In this model, the nucleation phase varies with mainshock magnitude, so we would expect mainshock magnitude to be correlated with the magnitude, number, or spatial extent of the foreshocks. We find no evidence for any of these correlations.},

	abstract = {Coulomb-stress theory has been used for years in seismology to understand how earthquakes trigger each other. Whenever an earthquake occurs, the stress field changes, and places with positive increases are brought closer to failure. Earthquake models that relate earthquake rates and Coulomb stress after a main event, such as the rate-and-state model, assume that the magnitude distribution of earthquakes is not affected by the change in the Coulomb stress. By using different slip models, we calculate the change in Coulomb stress in the fault plane for every aftershock after the Landers event (California, USA, 1992, moment magnitude 7.3). Applying several statistical analyses to test whether the distribution of magnitudes is sensitive to the sign of the Coulomb-stress increase, we are not able to find any significant effect. Further, whereas the events with a positive increase of the stress are characterized by a much larger proportion of strike-slip events in comparison with the seismicity previous to the mainshock, the events happening despite a decrease in Coulomb stress show no relevant differences in focal-mechanism distribution with respect to previous seismicity.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we carry out a comparison analysis of the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model for the earthquake process, embedded with the three main exponential-type distributions adopted in practical applications to describe the magnitudes of seismic events, that are, the Gutenberg–Richter (GR), the tapered Gutenberg–Richter (TGR) and the CHaracteristic (CH) frequency–magnitude distributions (FMDs). The first law is a pure-power decreasing function, while both the other two introduce a more rapid decay in the tail of the distribution: a soft taper in the TGR model and a sharp cut-off in the CH one. To perform the comparison, we first investigate some theoretical features of the ETAS model with CH-distributed magnitudes (ETAS-CH), which have not been deeply analysed in the literature as much as for ETAS-TGR and ETAS-GR. In particular, we explicitly compute the branching ratio, we analyse its asymptotics in relation to its parameters, and we derive the proper stability conditions. We then move to the comparison among the three ETAS-GR, ETAS-TGR and ETAS-CH processes, to highlight differences and similarities. This is done by carrying out both a theoretical analysis, mainly focused on the three models’ branching ratios and the relative sensitivity, and a simulation analysis of realistic synthetic catalogues to compare the processes’ numbers, events’ magnitude distribution and temporal evolution. The results we obtained show that the ETAS-TGR and ETAS-CH processes have very similar features. They both have also less restrictive non-explosion conditions than for ETAS-GR; in fact, differently from this latter case, their branching ratios exist for any value of the parameters and are lower than the one of ETAS-GR, to which they converge for large magnitudes.},

	abstract = {The magnitude–frequency distribution (MFD) of many earthquake catalogs is well described by the Gutenberg–Richter (GR) law or its tapered version (TGR). This distribution is usually extrapolated to any subsets of the space–time window covered by the catalog. However, some empirical observations and logical thoughts may raise doubts about the validity of this extrapolation. For example, according to the elastic rebound theory, we may assert that the probability of a strong shock nucleating within a short‐time interval in a small area A just ruptured by another strong event should be lower than that expected by GR (or TGR): a lot of energy has already been released, and it takes time to recover to the previous state. Here, we put forward a space–time modification of the TGR, named energy‐dependent TGR (TGRE) in which the corner seismic moment becomes a time‐varying energy function depending on (1) the conceivable strongest shock that may nucleate in A; (2) the time elapsed since the last strong earthquake that reset the elastic energy in A to a residual value; and (3) the rate of the energy recovery, linked to the recurrence time of the fault(s) involved. The model also verifies an invariance condition: for large space–time windows, the occurrence of a strong shock does not affect significantly the whole elastic energy available, that is, the TGRE becomes the TGR. The model is simple and rooted in clearly stated assumptions. To evaluate its reliability and applicability, we apply it to the 1992 Landers sequence. As expected by TGRE, we find that the MFD close to the fault system interested by the mainshock (Mw 7.3) differs from that of earthquakes off‐fault, showing a lower corner magnitude. We speculate that TGRE may be profitably used in operational earthquake forecasting and that it explains the empirical observation that the strongest aftershocks nucleate always outside the mainshock fault.},

	abstract = {An accumulation of seismic moment data gathered over the previous decade justifies a new attempt at a comprehensive statistical analysis of these data: herein, more rigourous statistical techniques are introduced, their properties investigated, and these methods are employed for analysis of large modern data sets. Several theoretical distributions of earthquake size (seismic moment–frequency relations) are described and compared. We discuss the requirements for such distributions and introduce an upper bound or a ‘corner moment’ for a distribution to have a finite energy or moment flux. We derive expressions for probability density functions and statistical moments of the distributions. We also describe parameter evaluation, in particular how to estimate the seismic moment distribution for the largest earthquakes. Simulating earthquake size distributions allows for a more rigourous evaluation of distribution parameters and points to the limitations of the classical statistical analysis of earthquake data. Simulations suggest that several earthquakes approaching or exceeding the corner magnitude (mc) limit need to be registered to evaluate mc with reasonable accuracy. Using the Harvard catalogue data, we compare moment distribution parameters for various temporal spans of the catalogue, for different tectonic provinces and depth ranges, and for earthquakes with various focal mechanisms. The statistical analysis suggests that the exponent β is universal (β = 0.60–0.65) for all moderate earthquakes. The corner moment (Mc) value, determined by the maximum-likelihood method, both in subduction zones and globally, is about 1021 N m, corresponding to the corner moment magnitude mc ≈ 8.0. For mid-oceanic earthquakes, mc is apparently smaller for spreading ridges, it is about 5.8, and for strike-slip earthquakes on transform faults it decreases from 7.2 to 6.5 as the relative slip velocity of faults increases. We investigate the seismic moment errors, both random and systematic, and their dependence on earthquake size. The relative errors seem to decrease for larger events. The influence of moment uncertainties on the parameter estimates is studied. Whereas the β values do not appear to be significantly influenced by the errors, for the corner moment large errors can lead to substantially biased estimates. We compare the Harvard catalogue results with the earthquake data from instrumental catalogues in the first three-quarters of the 20th century. Several very large earthquakes (m ≥ 9) occurred around the middle of the century. Their magnitude values cannot be fitted by a modified Gutenberg–Richter law with mc = 8.0–8.5. Among other factors, this discrepancy can be explained by either substantially higher errors in the earlier magnitude values, or by mc being higher for some subduction zones. It is unlikely that data available presently or soon will be sufficient to determine the corner magnitude of 9 and above, with reasonable precision, using purely statistical methods.},

Although seismology provides the most unambiguous data, there is great need for close coordination of results from other geophysical disciplines.

	abstract = {We propose a version of the pure temporal epidemic type aftershock sequences (ETAS) model: the ETAS model with correlated magnitudes. As for the standard case, we assume the Gutenberg-Richter law to be the probability density for the magnitudes of the background events. Instead, the magnitude of the triggered shocks is assumed to be probabilistically dependent on that of the relative mother events. This probabilistic dependence is motivated by some recent works in the literature and by the results of a statistical analysis made on some seismic catalogs [Spassiani and Sebastiani, J. Geophys. Res. 121, 903 (2016)]. On the basis of the experimental evidences obtained in the latter paper for the real catalogs, we theoretically derive the probability density function for the magnitudes of the triggered shocks proposed in Spassiani and Sebastiani and there used for the analysis of two simulated catalogs. To this aim, we impose a fundamental condition: averaging over all the magnitudes of the mother events, we must obtain again the Gutenberg-Richter law. This ensures the validity of this law at any event's generation when ignoring past seismicity. The ETAS model with correlated magnitudes is then theoretically analyzed here. In particular, we use the tool of the probability generating function and the Palm theory, in order to derive an approximation of the probability of zero events in a small time interval and to interpret the results in terms of the interevent time between consecutive shocks, the latter being a very useful random variable in the assessment of seismic hazard.},

We find that the strike‐slip fault is 50\% rougher in the slip‐perpendicular direction than parallel to slip. 3D mapping of fault roughness at seismogenic depths suggests that roughness varies by a factor of 8 for length scales of 1 km. We observe that the largest earthquake (M 4.4) occurred where there is significant fault complexity and the highest measured roughness. We also find that b‐values are weakly positively correlated with fault roughness. Following the largest earthquake, we observe a distinct population of earthquakes with comparatively low b‐values occurring in an area of high roughness within the rupture area of the M 4.4 earthquake. Finally, we measure roughness at multiple scales and find that the fault is self‐affine with a Hurst exponent of 0.52, consistent with a Brownian surface.},

	abstract = {We report laboratory experiments on rippled granular surfaces formed under rolling wheels. Ripples appear above a critical speed and drift slowly in the driving direction. Ripples coarsen as they saturate and exhibit ripple creation and destruction events. All of these effects are captured qualitatively by 2D soft-particle simulations in which a disk rolls over smaller disks in a periodic box. The simulations show that compaction and segregation are inessential to the ripple phenomenon. We describe a simplified scaling model which gives some insight into the mechanism of the instability.},

	abstract = {Using the method developed by Hardebeck and Shearer (2002, 2003) termed the HASH method, we calculate focal mechanisms for earthquakes that occurred in the southern California region from 1981 to 2010. When available, we use hypocenters refined with differential travel times from waveform cross correlation. Using both the P‐wave first motion polarities and the S/P amplitude ratios computed from three‐component seismograms, we determine mechanisms for more than 480,000 earthquakes and analyze the statistical features of the whole catalog. We filter the preliminary catalog with criteria associated with mean nodal plane uncertainty and azimuthal gap and obtain a high‐quality catalog with approximately 179,000 focal mechanisms. As more S/P amplitude ratios become available after 2000, the average nodal plane uncertainty decreases significantly compared with mechanisms that include only P‐wave polarities. In general the parameters of the focal mechanisms have been stable during the three decades. The dominant style of faulting is high angle strike‐slip faulting with the most likely P axis centered at N5°E. For earthquakes of M\&lt;2.5, there are more normal‐faulting events than reverse‐faulting events, while the opposite holds for M\&gt;2.5 events. Using the 210 moment‐tensor solutions in Tape et al. (2010) as benchmarks, we compare the focal plane rotation angles of common events in the catalog. Seventy percent of common earthquakes match well with rotation angles less than the typical nodal plane uncertainty. The common events with relatively large rotation angles are either located around the edge of the (SCSN) network or poorly recorded.Online Material: Table of HASH parameter settings and figures of 1D velocity models, distribution of earthquakes with different focal‐mechanism qualities, comparison of YHS2010 and HS2003 catalogs, and distributions of earthquake focal mechanisms.},

We find that currently it is still quite challenging to get reliable Mw using the peak ground displacement or peak ground velocity approach, which is caused by the sparse stations and probably the inaccurate scaling law itself. By contrast, the Mw estimations from focal mechanism grid search are all consistent with Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog, even by one station. Considering the CMONOC network is going to be densified in the coming decade, it is expected that high‐rate GNSS waveforms will play a more important role in fast postevent response.},

Continuous replica-symmetry breaking allows for a power-law behavior ρ(∆M ) ∼ 1/(∆M )τ with exponent τ = 1 for SK, related to the criticality (marginal stability) of the spin-glass phase. All scales of the ultrametric phase space are implicated in jump events. Similar results are obtained for the sizes S of static jumps of pinned elastic systems, or of shocks in Burgers turbulence in large dimension. In all cases with a one-step solution, ρ(S) ∼ Se−AS2 .

There has been a conceptual change in the indications and surgical technique in the last 40 years. A comparative study between the various methods of tonsillectomy was done. The study was carried out in the single institutional set up by the same surgeon but using different techniques. The study aimed at comparing the intra-operative factors (blood loss, time taken for surgery), postoperative results (pain, bleeding, dehydration, time taken for complete healing), and other complications like vomiting and hospitalization time between different groups of surgical methods. This study was done in 2500 patients undergoing tonsillectomy with or without adenoid removal in a period of 35 years (1979–2013). The majority of the patients (approximately 41\%) in the first half of this period underwent cold steel tonsillectomy whereas 39\% underwent microdebrider assisted tonsillectomy. Microdebrider assisted tonsil surgery was done as day care procedure in 90\%. In 21\% of the patients, other methods viz coblation, radio frequency and laser were used. Microdebrider intracapsular tonsillectomy is associated with lower mortality and morbidity as compared to cold steel, coblation, electrodissection, laser and radio frequency.},

This paper reviews its applications to historical earthquakes from China, Iran and Japan, thereby extending and supporting earlier work on the Chinese historical data. The model generally provides an improvement in fit over Poisson models with either constant rate or linear trend. A crucial factor is the identification of suitable subregions which can act as largely independent seismic units. In northern China, divisions into two and four such units are considered based on recognized geophysical subdivisions. In Iran, the best results are obtained from a subdivision into three such units. The situation in Japan seems more complex: a preliminary model with two units gives a significant improvement of fit in one out of the two cases. In all regions treating the subregions separately gives marked improvements over treating the whole region as a single unit. However, the quality of fit within subregions differs sharply from case to case, pointing to substantial differences in the seismic regimes as reflected in the historical data.},

Using the general class of epidemic type aftershock sequence (ETAS) models and rigorous pseudo-prospective experiments, we show that ETAS models featuring a specific magnitude correlation between triggered and triggering earthquakes and a magnitude-dependent Omori kernel significantly outperform simpler ETAS models, in which these features are absent. Using the best forecasting model, we then show that large events preferentially trigger large earthquakes. These findings have far-reaching implications for short-term and medium-term seismic risk assessment and the development of a deeper theory without UV cut-off that is locally self-similar.},

Earthquakes are an important part of the relaxation mechanism of the crust which is submitted to inhomogeneous increasing stresses accumulating at continental-plate borders. The SOC concept then implies that earthquakes in turn organize the crust both at the spatial and temporal levels. This idea allows to rationalize observations on occurrences and magnitudes of earthquakes. Variants of SOC as well as a novel type of dynamics based on “waiting times” are discussed within a mean-field-like approach which shows the existence of 1/f noise in the time gap between large earthquakes. The corresponding long-time correlations have important implications for the statistical long-time forecasting of earthquakes.},

	abstract = {A good estimation of the b-value is crucial for the earthquake hazard assessment. Its evaluation can be strongly affected by an incorrect estimation of the completeness magnitude mc because a too small mc will reflect into a small b-value, whereas a too large mc will imply a larger standard deviation due to the reduction of the magnitude interval. Several methods for the estimation of mc exist, however its evaluation is very delicate and requires some critical decision making in most cases. Here we present a new, very rapid and simple method for mc estimation. It is based on the observation that the Gutenberg-Richter distribution is an exponential one only for magnitudes larger than mc. As a consequence, the average magnitude ma value should increase linearly with a threshold magnitude mth. The departures from such linear behavior, allows a correct estimation of mc, whereas the linearity of the of ma versus mth allows a correct estimation of the b-value.},

	abstract = {Introduced by the late Per Bak and his colleagues, self-organized criticality (SOC) has been one of the most stimulating concepts to come out of statistical mechanics and condensed matter theory in the last few decades, and has played a significant role in the development of complexity science. SOC, and more generally fractals and power laws, have attracted much comment, ranging from the very positive to the polemical. The other papers (Aschwanden et al. in Space Sci. Rev., 2014, this issue; McAteer et al. in Space Sci. Rev., 2015, this issue; Sharma et al. in Space Sci. Rev. 2015, in preparation) in this special issue showcase the considerable body of observations in solar, magnetospheric and fusion plasma inspired by the SOC idea, and expose the fertile role the new paradigm has played in approaches to modeling and understanding multiscale plasma instabilities. This very broad impact, and the necessary process of adapting a scientific hypothesis to the conditions of a given physical system, has meant that SOC as studied in these fields has sometimes differed significantly from the definition originally given by its creators. In Bak’s own field of theoretical physics there are significant observational and theoretical open questions, even 25 years on (Pruessner 2012). One aim of the present review is to address the dichotomy between the great reception SOC has received in some areas, and its shortcomings, as they became manifest in the controversies it triggered. Our article tries to clear up what we think are misunderstandings of SOC in fields more remote from its origins in statistical mechanics, condensed matter and dynamical systems by revisiting Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld’s original papers.},

	abstract = {The b value of the Gutenberg–Richter (GR) distribution is estimated as a function of a threshold magnitude mth and it is found to depend on mth for magnitudes larger than the completeness magnitude mc. We identify a magnitude interval [mc, mm] where b is a decreasing function of mth followed by a regime of increasing b for large magnitudes. This is a common feature of experimental catalogues for different geographic areas. The increase at large mth is explained in terms of an upper magnitude cut-off in experimental catalogues due to finite size effects. We develop a rigorous mathematical framework to relate the decrease of b in the intermediate regime to the functional form of the distribution of the b values. We propose two hypotheses: The first is that the spatial and temporal variability of b leads to a b distribution peaked around its average value. The second is that main shocks and aftershocks are distributed according to the GR law with different b values, leading to a bimodal distribution of b. Simulated Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequences catalogues, generated according to this hypothesis, exhibit the same magnitude distribution of experimental ones. In alternative, we cannot exclude the b dependence on m caused by magnitudes not homogeneously evaluated in a seismic catalogue. In the latter scenario our results provide the correction terms to the estimated magnitudes.},

The level of conservation is a function of the relevant elastic parameters describing the model. The model exhibits power law distributions for the energy released during an earthquake. The corresponding exponent is not universal. It is a function of the level of conservation. Thus the observed variation in the b value in the Gutenberg-Richter law could be explained by a variation in the elastic parameters. We address the problem of the boundary conditions and display results for two extreme possibilities. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation in the interoccurrence time of earthquakes. The model exhibits the features of real earthquakes: the occurrence of small earthquakes is random, while the larger earthquakes seem to be bunched. Primarily, the results of our work indicate that the dynamic of earthquakes is intimately related to the nonconservative nature of the model, which gives birth to both the change in the exponent and the correlations in interoccurrence time.},

Because of the magnitude correlations intrinsic in the validated model, we further rationalize the existence of earthquake doublets.

We have shown that the Olami–Feder–Christensen (OFC) model for the dynamics of earthquakes, deÿned both in square and cubic lattices, is able to reproduce this new behavior. The distribution of distances between successive earthquakes is also presented. Our results indicate the robustness of the OFC model to describe earthquake dynamics. Surprisingly, we found that only the non-conservative version of the OFC model generates a network with scale-free properties. The conservative version, instead, behaves like a random graph. The distribution of distances in 3-D and the distribution of connectivities in a 2-D lattice conÿrm the di erences observed between the conservative and non-conservative regime.},

	title = {Self-organized criticality},
	abstract = {The concept of self-organized criticality was introduced to explain the behaviour of the sandpile model. In this model, particles are randomly dropped onto a square grid of boxes. When a box accumulates four particles they are redistributed to the four adjacent boxes or lost off the edge of the grid. Redistributions can lead to further instabilities with the possibility of more particles being lost from the grid, contributing to the size of each ‘avalanche’. These model ‘avalanches’ satisﬁed a power-law frequency–area distribution with a slope near unity. Other cellular-automata models, including the slider-block and forest-ﬁre models, are also said to exhibit self-organized critical behaviour. It has been argued that earthquakes, landslides, forest ﬁres, and species extinctions are examples of self-organized criticality in nature. In addition, wars and stock market crashes have been associated with this behaviour. The forest-ﬁre model is particularly interesting in terms of its relation to the critical-point behaviour of the sitepercolation model. In the basic forest-ﬁre model, trees are randomly planted on a grid of points. Periodically in time, sparks are randomly dropped on the grid. If a spark drops on a tree, that tree and adjacent trees burn in a model ﬁre. The ﬁres are the ‘avalanches’ and they are found to satisfy power-law frequency–area distributions with slopes near unity. This forest-ﬁre model is closely related to the site-percolation model, that exhibits critical behaviour. In the forest-ﬁre model there is an inverse cascade of trees from small clusters to large clusters, trees are lost primarily from model ﬁres that destroy the largest clusters. This quasi steady-state cascade gives a power-law frequency–area distribution for both clusters of trees and smaller ﬁres. The site-percolation model is equivalent to the forest-ﬁre model without ﬁres. In this case there is a transient cascade of trees from small to large clusters and a power-law distribution is found only at a critical density of trees.},

Despite increasingly high-quality geodetic, seismic and field observations, data-driven earthquake imaging yields stark differences and physics-based models explaining all observed dynamic complexities are elusive. Here we present data-assimilated three-dimensional dynamic rupture models of California’s biggest earthquakes in more than 20 years: the moment magnitude (Mw) 6.4 Searles Valley and Mw 7.1 Ridgecrest sequence, which ruptured multiple segments of a non-vertical quasi-orthogonal conjugate fault system1. Our models use supercomputing to find the link between the two earthquakes. We explain strong-motion, teleseismic, field mapping, high-rate global positioning system and space geodetic datasets with earthquake physics. We find that regional structure, ambient long- and short-term stress, and dynamic and static fault system interactions driven by overpressurized fluids and low dynamic friction are conjointly crucial to understand the dynamics and delays of the sequence. We demonstrate that a joint physics-based and data-driven approach can be used to determine the mechanics of complex fault systems and earthquake sequences when reconciling dense earthquake recordings, three-dimensional regional structure and stress models. We foresee that physics-based interpretation of big observational datasets will have a transformative impact on future geohazard mitigation.},

The corresponding exponent is not universal. It is a function of the level of conservation. Thus the observed variation in the b value in the Gutenberg-Richter law could be explained by a variation in the elastic parameters. We address the problem of the boundary conditions and display results for two extreme possibilities. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation in the interoccurrence time of earthquakes. The model exhibits the features of real earthquakes: the occurrence of small earthquakes is random, while the larger earthquakes seem to be bunched. Primarily, the results of our work indicate that the dynamic of earthquakes is intimately related to the nonconservative nature of the model, which gives birth to both the change in the exponent and the correlations in interoccurrence time.},

This idea allows to rationalize observations on occurrences and magnitudes of earthquakes. Variants of SOC as well as a novel type of dynamics based on “waiting times” are discussed within a mean-field-like approach which shows the existence of 1/f noise in the time gap between large earthquakes. The corresponding long-time correlations have important implications for the statistical long-time forecasting of earthquakes.},

We derive formulae to estimate parameters of the seismic moment distributions by comparing the earthquake occurrence rate with tectonic strain. We analyse the tectonic moment rate and the earthquake moment distribution for several types of tectonic environments, including subduction zones, plate bounding transform faults and deforming continental regions. In this analysis we use finer subdivisions of tectonic regions to infer whether earthquake size distribution properties established previously for large provinces (Flinn–Engdahl seismic regions) could be applied to smaller zones extending over a few hundred kilometres. Although the shortness of the available earthquake catalogues makes our results less reliable, several conclusions can be drawn from the analysis. The universality of the β-parameter (the slope of the moment–frequency relation) is reasonably well confirmed for all of these tectonic regions and their subdivisions. In each region, we estimate the strain rate or relative plate motion from a plate tectonic model, active fault data or geodetic data. According to the moment–frequency relation, the ratio of the tectonic moment rate to the earthquake rate depends on the β value, the corner magnitude (mc) and the effective seismogenic thickness. We find that this ratio does not vary systematically with the relative plate velocity, the ratio of parallel to perpendicular plate motion, time since the last major earthquake and the length of fault zone segments established by previous earthquake history. We obtain similar results for the western United States and southeast Asia; the corner magnitude is approximately equal to that for the circum-Pacific Rim and there is no systematic dependence of the mc parameter on a geographic region or strain rate. Assuming the commonly accepted values for seismogenic thickness, elastic modulus and 100 per cent seismic coupling, the corner magnitude values for plate boundary zones and continental areas are 8.3–8.8, i.e. similar to those values obtained by statistical analysis.},

	abstract = {To understand whether the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers earthquake changed the proximity to failure on the San Andreas fault system, we examine the general problem of how one earthquake might trigger another. The tendency of rocks to fail in a brittle manner is thought to be a function of both shear and confining stresses, commonly formulated as the Coulomb failure criterion. Here we explore how changes in Coulomb conditions associated with one or more earthquakes may trigger subsequent events. We first consider a Coulomb criterion appropriate for the production of aftershocks, where faults most likely to slip are those optimally orientated for failure as a result of the prevailing regional stress field and the stress change caused by the mainshock. We find that the distribution of aftershocks for the Landers earthquake, as well as for several other moderate events in its vicinity, can be explained by the Coulomb criterion as follows: aftershocks are abundant where the Coulomb stress on optimally orientated faults rose by more than one-half bar, and aftershocks are sparse where the Coulomb stress dropped by a similar amount. Further, we find that several moderate shocks raised the stress at the future Landers epicenter and along much of the Landers rupture zone by about a bar, advancing the Landers shock by 1 to 3 centuries. The Landers rupture, in turn, raised the stress at site of the future M = 6.5 Big Bear aftershock site by 3 bars. The Coulomb stress change on a specified fault is independent of regional stress but depends on the fault geometry, sense of slip, and the coefficient of friction. We use this method to resolve stress changes on the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults imposed by the Landers sequence. Together the Landers and Big Bear earthquakes raised the stress along the San Bernardino segment of the southern San Andreas fault by 2 to 6 bars, hastening the next great earthquake there by about a decade.},

I determine the parameters of the Omori and Gutenberg-Richter laws for aftershocks close in time to a mainshock. Aftershock sequences of large earthquakes in southern California (1952 Kern County, 1992 Joshua Tree-Landers-Big Bear sequence, 1994 Northridge, and 1999 Hector Mine), recorded in the CalTech catalog, are analyzed to demonstrate that at the beginning of these series, many small earthquakes are absent from the catalog. The number of missing earthquakes increases with the magnitude range of a catalog and for some data sets exceeds the number of aftershocks close to a mainshock listed in a catalog. Comparing global earthquake catalogs (Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor and Preliminary Determination of Epicenter) with local data sets indicates that the catalogs based on longer period waves miss many early aftershocks even when their magnitudes are well above the stated magnitude threshold. Such short-term incompleteness may introduce significant biases to the statistical analysis of the seismicity pattern, in particular for branching models of earthquake occurrence incorporating the Omori law. For such models the likelihood function strongly depends on close aftershocks. I review the techniques to alleviate this problem. Analyzing the source rupture process of several recent large earthquakes suggests that rupture propagation is highly inhomogeneous in space, time, and focal mechanism. These random variations in the rupture process can be viewed as an extension of the aftershock stochastic generating mechanism toward the origin time of a mainshock. I review various models of the earthquake rupture process and suggest that fractal distributions of microevents in time, space, and focal mechanism constitute the development of an earthquake. The final identification of an individual earthquake depends on both objective and subjective factors.},

The different techniques provide information on different time scales and on the spatial extent of weakened damaged regions. Techniques (i) and (ii) use declustered catalogues to avoid the occasional strong fluctuations associated with aftershock sequences, while technique (iii) examines developing clusters in entire catalogue data. We analyse primarily earthquakes around large faults that are locked in the interseismic periods, and examine also as a contrasting example seismicity from the creeping Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault. Results of analysis (i) show that the M \&gt; 7 Landers 1992, Hector Mine 1999, El Mayor-Cucapah 2010 and Ridgecrest 2019 main shocks in Southern and Baja California were preceded in the previous decades by generation of rock damage around the eventual rupture zones.

Results with technique (iii) indicate that individual events tend to coalesce rapidly to clusters in the final 1–2 yr before the main shocks. Corresponding analyses of data from the Parkfield region show opposite delocalization patterns and decreasing clustering before the 2004 M6 earthquake. Continuing studies with these techniques, combined with analysis of geodetic data and insights from laboratory experiments and model simulations, might improve the ability to track preparation processes leading to large earthquakes.},

	abstract = {For the public, the main question that seismologists should ask themselves is, "Can earthquakes be predicted?". Nature's earthquake prediction debate follows this simple line of inquiry, although presented in a slightly more subtle form by Ian Main: "How accurately and reliably can we predict earthquakes, and how far can we go in investigating the degree of predictability that might exist?" This is still, however, a question formulated under social pressure. I argue that this question should be left to one side by scientists to allow progress in a more general and comprehensive framework, by studying the whole set of crustal instabilities — or 'transients' — and not only earthquake precursors.},

A key motivation for this community effort is that more data should translate into better earthquake forecasts. Such improvements are yet to be seen. Here, we introduce the Recurrent Earthquake foreCAST (RECAST), a deep-learning model based on recent developments in neural temporal point processes. The model enables access to a greater volume and diversity of earthquake observations, overcoming the theoretical and computational limitations of traditional approaches. We benchmark against a temporal Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model. Tests on synthetic data suggest that with a modest-sized data set, RECAST accurately models earthquake-like point processes directly from cataloged data. Tests on earthquake catalogs in Southern California indicate improved fit and forecast accuracy compared to our benchmark when the training set is sufficiently long ({\textgreater}104 events). The basic components in RECAST add flexibility and scalability for earthquake forecasting without sacrificing performance.},

In addition, the concepts such as temporal variations, fractal dimension, and the correct estimate of b and its uncertainty are discussed. Spatially mapping b-values has proven to be a rich source of information about the seismotectonics of a region. The ample, high-quality earthquake catalogs collected primarily over the past several years and the availability of increased computing power have enabled researchers to investigate spatial variations in b with an unprecedented level of detail. The discovery of strong differences in b is simply a reflection of the heterogeneity of the Earth that emerges on all scales, once suitable datasets become available. The first step in extracting information from the heterogeneity in the b-value is to determine with what other parameters these variations correlate.},

Using 13,525 routinely cataloged events as waveform templates, I detect and precisely locate a total of 34,091 events. Precisely located earthquakes reveal numerous crosscutting fault structures with dominantly perpendicular southwest and northwest strikes. Foreshocks of the Mw 6.4 event appear to align on a northwest‐striking fault. Aftershocks of the Mw 6.4 event suggest that it further ruptured this northwest‐striking fault, as well as the southwest‐striking fault where surface rupture was observed. Finally, aftershocks of the Mw 7.1 show a highly complex distribution, illuminating a primary northwest‐striking fault zone consistent with surface rupture but also numerous crosscutting southwest‐striking faults. Aftershock relocations suggest that the Mw 7.1 event ruptured adjacent to the previous northwest‐striking rupture of the Mw 6.4, perhaps activating a subparallel structure southwest of the earlier rupture. Both the northwest and southeast rupture termini of the Mw 7.1 rupture exhibited multiple fault branching, with particularly high rates of aftershocks and multiple fault orientations in the dilatational quadrant northeast of the northwest rupture terminus.},

The main parameter of this relation, the b-value, controls the relative rate of small and large earthquakes. Resolving spatiotemporal variations of the b-value is critical to understanding the earthquake occurrence process and improving earthquake forecasting. However, this variation is not well understood. Here we present remarkable MFD variability during the complex 2016/17 central Italy sequence using a high-resolution earthquake catalog. Isolating seismically active volumes (‘clusters’) reveals that the MFD differed in nearby clusters, varied or remained constant in time depending on the cluster, and increased in b-value in the cluster where the largest earthquake eventually occurred. These findings suggest that the fault system’s heterogeneity and complexity influence the MFD. Our findings raise the question “b-value of what?”: interpreting and using MFD variability needs a spatiotemporal scale that is physically meaningful, like the one proposed here.},

Statistically significant variations of b values have been measured in laboratory experiments, mines and various tectonic regimes such as subducting slabs, near magma chambers, along fault zones and in aftershock zones3. However, it has remained uncertain whether these differences are due to differing stress regimes, as it was questionable that samples in small volumes (such as in laboratory specimens, mines and the shallow Earth's crust) are representative of earthquakes in general. Given the lack of physical understanding of these differences, the observation that b values approach the constant 1 if large volumes are sampled4 was interpreted to indicate that b = 1 is a universal constant for earthquakes in general5. Here we show that the b value varies systematically for different styles of faulting. We find that normal faulting events have the highest b values, thrust events the lowest and strike-slip events intermediate values. Given that thrust faults tend to be under higher stress than normal faults we infer that the b value acts as a stress meter that depends inversely on differential stress.},

The size of AE events displays power law distributions, conforming to the Gutenberg-Richter law observed for earthquakes, which is characterized by the b value. As the confining pressure increases, the macroscopic behavior becomes more ductile. For all different stages of the rock mechanical behavior (linear, nonlinear prepeak, nonlinear postpeak, shearing), there is a systematic decrease of the b value with increasing confining pressure. A numerical model based on progressive elastic damage and the finite element method allows simulations of the main experimental observations on AE and of a wide range of macroscopic behaviors from brittleness to ductility. The model reproduces a decrease in the b value that appears to be related to the type of macroscopic behavior (brittle-ductile) rather than to the confining pressure. Both experimental and numerical results suggest a relationship between the b value and the brittle-ductile transition. Moreover, these results are consistent with recent earthquake observations and give new insight into the behavior of the Earth's crust.},

We investigate variations in seismic b value of acoustic emission events during the stress buildup and release on laboratory-created fault zones. We show that b values mirror periodic stress changes that occur during series of stick-slip events, and are correlated with stress over many seismic cycles. Moreover, the amount of b value increase associated with slip events indicates the extent of the corresponding stress drop.

The frequency-magnitude relation for events which accompanied frictional sliding and deformation of a ductile rock was found to have a much higher b value than that observed in brittle rock.

	abstract = {A clear case has been established for a significant increase in the slope of the frequency-magnitude relation for periods of up to six years before a number of earthquakes in New Zealand and California. In a region of about 200 km diameter in central New Zealand the b-value increased from near unity to more than 2.0 at the end of 1968, and remained abnormally high until the beginning of 1975. an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 followed in 1977 January, within 50 km of the location which had registered the highest b-value. the anomaly was detected in contour maps of b-values windowed in space and time, then resolved more precisely in time using the CUSUM technique. It was statistically significant at a level higher than 99.99 per cent. Compared with the average rate of moment release in this region, there was a deficit of 1.3 × 1018 Nm during the anomalous period, which is equivalent to an earthquake of magnitude 6.08. This phenomenon of a high b-value has been found before all shallow New Zealand earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or more since 1965, wherever the seismicity rate and detection threshold were adequate to resolve it. Further, the only statistically significant occurrences of high b-value were those which were followed by large earthquakes, two of magnitude 6.8 and 6.0 and a swarm of equivalent magnitude 5.3. the phenomenon has also been found before the San Fernando and Coalinga earthquakes in California, both of which were thrust events, but it is not apparent before two large Californian earthquakes with strike-slip mechanisms. Observations of high b-value are consistent with reported instances of quiescence in background seismicity. In fact, what has been interpreted as quiescence may probably be more accurately described as a localized high b-value. The duration of the anomaly is not a simple function of magnitude. Different strain rates in the regions examined may account for this. the available data suggest that careful monitoring of the b-value may provide a tool for medium-term earthquake prediction, although perhaps not in all tectonic environments.},

We review these statistical models and the wide-ranging research to advance aftershock forecasting through better statistical, physical, and machine-learning methods. Physics-based forecasts based on mainshock stress changes can sometimes match the statistical models in testing but do not yet outperform them. Physical models are also hampered by unsolved problems such as the mechanics of dynamic triggering and the influence of background conditions.

In the absence of disorder, rate-and-state approaches predict a diverging nucleation length at some stress σ∗, beyond which cracks can propagate. Here we argue for a flat interface that disorder is a relevant perturbation to this description. We justify why the distribution of slip contains two parts: a power law corresponding to “avalanches” and a “narrow” distribution of system-spanning “fracture” events. We derive novel scaling relations for avalanches, including a relation between the stress drop and the spatial extension of a slip event. We compute the cut-off length beyond which avalanches cannot be stopped by disorder, leading to a system-spanning fracture, and successfully test these predictions in a minimal model of frictional interfaces.},

	abstract = {Point processes have been dominant in modeling the evolution of seismicity for decades, with the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model being most popular. Recent advances in machine learning have constructed highly flexible point process models using neural networks to improve upon existing parametric models. We investigate whether these flexible point process models can be applied to short-term seismicity forecasting by extending an existing temporal neural model to the magnitude domain and we show how this model can forecast earthquakes above a target magnitude threshold. We first demonstrate that the neural model can fit synthetic ETAS data, however, requiring less computational time because it is not dependent on the full history of the sequence. By artificially emulating short-term aftershock incompleteness in the synthetic data set, we find that the neural model outperforms ETAS. Using a new enhanced catalog from the 2016–2017 Central Apennines earthquake sequence, we investigate the predictive skill of ETAS and the neural model with respect to the lowest input magnitude. Constructing multiple forecasting experiments using the Visso, Norcia and Campotosto earthquakes to partition training and testing data, we target M3+ events. We find both models perform similarly at previously explored thresholds (e.g., above M3), but lowering the threshold to M1.2 reduces the performance of ETAS unlike the neural model. We argue that some of these gains are due to the neural model's ability to handle incomplete data. The robustness to missing data and speed to train the neural model present it as an encouraging competitor in earthquake forecasting.},
