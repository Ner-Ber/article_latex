This article discusses several classes of stochastic models for the origin times and magnitudes of earthquakes. The models are compared for a Japanese data set for the years 1885-1980 using likelihood methods. For the best model, a change of time scale is made to investigate the deviation of the data from the model. Conventional graphical methods associated with stationary Poisson processes can be used with the transformed time scale. For point processes, effective use of such residual analysis makes it possible to find features of the data set that are not captured in the model. Based on such analyses, the utility of seismic quiescence for the prediction of a major earthquake is investigated.},

	abstract = {Following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, the Dipartimento della Protezione Civile Italiana (DPC), appointed an International Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF) to report on the current state of knowledge of short-term prediction and forecasting of tectonic earthquakes and indicate guidelines for utilization of possible forerunners of large earthquakes to drive civil protection actions, including the use of probabilistic seismic hazard analysis in the wake of a large earthquake. The ICEF reviewed research on earthquake prediction and forecasting, drawing from developments in seismically active regions worldwide. A prediction is defined as a deterministic statement that a future earthquake will or will not occur in a particular geographic region, time window, and magnitude range, whereas a forecast gives a probability (greater than zero but less than one) that such an event will occur. Earthquake predictability, the degree to which the future occurrence of earthquakes can be determined from the observable behavior of earthquake systems, is poorly understood. This lack of understanding is reflected in the inability to reliably predict large earthquakes in seismically active regions on short time scales. Most proposed prediction methods rely on the concept of a diagnostic precursor; i.e., some kind of signal observable before earthquakes that indicates with high probability the location, time, and magnitude of an impending event. Precursor methods reviewed here include changes in strain rates, seismic wave speeds, and electrical conductivity; variations of radon concentrations in groundwater, soil, and air; fluctuations in groundwater levels; electromagnetic variations near and above Earth's surface; thermal anomalies; anomalous animal behavior; and seismicity patterns. The search for diagnostic precursors has not yet produced a successful short-term prediction scheme. Therefore, this report focuses on operational earthquake forecasting as the principle means for gathering and disseminating authoritative information about time-dependent seismic hazards to help communities prepare for potentially destructive earthquakes. On short time scales of days and weeks, earthquake sequences show clustering in space and time, as indicated by the aftershocks triggered by large events. Statistical descriptions of clustering explain many features observed in seismicity catalogs, and they can be used to construct forecasts that indicate how earthquake probabilities change over the short term. Properly applied, short-term forecasts have operational utility; for example, in anticipating aftershocks that follow large earthquakes. Although the value of long-term forecasts for ensuring seismic safety is clear, the interpretation of short-term forecasts is problematic, because earthquake probabilities may vary over orders of magnitude but typically remain low in an absolute sense ({\textgreater} 1\% per day). Translating such low-probability forecasts into effective decision-making is a difficult challenge. Reports on the current utilization operational forecasting in earthquake risk management were compiled for six countries with high seismic risk: China, Greece, Italy, Japan, Russia, United States. Long-term models are currently the most important forecasting tools for civil protection against earthquake damage, because they guide earthquake safety provisions of building codes, performance-based seismic design, and other risk-reducing engineering practices, such as retrofitting to correct design flaws in older buildings. Short-term forecasting of aftershocks is practiced by several countries among those surveyed, but operational earthquake forecasting has not been fully implemented (i.e., regularly updated and on a national scale) in any of them. Based on the experience accumulated in seismically active regions, the ICEF has provided to DPC a set of recommendations on the utilization of operational forecasting in Italy, which may also be useful in other countries. The public should be provided with open sources of information about the short-term probabilities of future earthquakes that are authoritative, scientific, consistent, and timely. Advisories should be based on operationally qualified, regularly updated seismicity forecasting systems that have been rigorously reviewed and updated by experts in the creation,delivery, and utility of earthquake information. The quality of all operational models should be evaluated for reliability and skill by retrospective testing, and they should be under continuous prospective testing against established long-term forecasts and alternative time-dependent models. Alert procedures should be standardized to facilitate decisions at different levels of government and among the public. Earthquake probability thresholds should be established to guide alert levels based on objective analysis of costs and benefits, as well as the less tangible aspects of value-of-information, such as gains in psychological preparedness and resilience. The principles of effective public communication established by social science research should be applied to the delivery of seismic hazard information. ¬© 2011 by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia.

Identifying a broadened forecasting procedure for general models of space‚Äìtime magnitude sequences may enhance the information gain of earthquake forecasts. This article explores and evaluates three such models for earthquake magnitude forecasting. The first model forecasts magnitudes by location‚Äêdependent b‚Äêvalues; the second model forecasts magnitudes by space‚Äìtime weighted moving average of the short‚Äêterm past and neighboring magnitude sequence; and the third forecasts based on short‚Äêterm tightness of clustering among earthquakes. The forecasting performances of these models estimated in a learning period are shown at each time in a testing period.

The indicators are selected based on the Gutenberg-Richter and characteristic earthquake magnitude distribution and also on the conclusions drawn by recent earthquake prediction studies. Since there is no known established mathematical or even empirical relationship between these indicators and the location and magnitude of a succeeding earthquake in a particular time window, the problem is modeled using three different neural networks: a feed-forward Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (LMBP) neural network, a recurrent neural network, and a radial basis function (RBF) neural network. Prediction accuracies of the models are evaluated using four different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the true skill score or R score. The models are trained and tested using data for two seismically different regions: Southern California and the San Francisco bay region. Overall the recurrent neural network model yields the best prediction accuracies compared with LMBP and RBF networks. While at the present earthquake prediction cannot be made with a high degree of certainty this research provides a scientific approach for evaluating the short-term seismic hazard potential of a region.},

	abstract = {Aftershocks are a response to changes in stress generated by large earthquakes and represent the most common observations of the triggering of earthquakes. The maximum magnitude of aftershocks and their temporal decay are well described by empirical laws (such as Bath‚Äôs law1 and Omori‚Äôs law2), but explaining and forecasting the spatial distribution of aftershocks is more difficult. Coulomb failure stress change3 is perhaps the most widely used criterion to explain the spatial distributions of aftershocks4‚Äì8, but its applicability has been disputed9‚Äì11. Here we use a deep-learning approach to identify a static-stress-based criterion¬†that forecasts aftershock locations without prior assumptions about fault orientation. We show that a neural network trained on more than 131,000 mainshock‚Äìaftershock pairs can predict the locations of aftershocks in an independent test dataset of more than 30,000 mainshock‚Äìaftershock pairs more accurately (area under curve of 0.849) than can classic Coulomb failure stress change (area under curve of 0.583). We find that the learned aftershock pattern is physically interpretable: the maximum change in shear stress, the von Mises yield criterion (a scaled version of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress-change¬†tensor) and the sum of the absolute values of the independent components of the stress-change tensor each explain more than 98 per cent of the variance in the neural-network prediction. This machine-learning-driven insight provides improved forecasts of aftershock locations and identifies physical quantities that may control earthquake triggering during the most active part of the seismic cycle.},

The indicators considered are the time elapsed during a particular number (n) of significant seismic events before the month in question, the slope of the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter inverse power law curve for the n events, the mean square deviation about the regression line based on the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter inverse power law for the n events, the average magnitude of the last n events, the difference between the observed maximum magnitude among the last n events and that expected through the Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter relationship known as the magnitude deficit, the rate of square root of seismic energy released during the n events, the mean time or period between characteristic events, and the coefficient of variation of the mean time. Prediction accuracies of the model are evaluated using three different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, and the true skill score or R score. The PNN model is trained and tested using data for the Southern California region. The model yields good prediction accuracies for earthquakes of magnitude between 4.5 and 6.0. The PNN model presented in this paper complements the recurrent neural network model developed by the authors previously, where good results were reported for predicting earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6.0.},

	abstract = {The driving concept behind one of the most successful statistical forecasting models, the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) model, has been that the seismicity is driven by spontaneously occurring background earthquakes that cascade into multitudes of triggered earthquakes. In nearly all generalizations of the ETAS model, the magnitudes of the background and the triggered earthquakes are assumed to follow Gutenberg-Richter law with the same exponent (Œ≤ value). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the triggered earthquakes are always assumed to be independent of the magnitude of the triggering earthquake. Using an expectation maximization algorithm applied to the Californian earthquake catalog, we show that the distribution of earthquake magnitudes exhibits three distinct Œ≤ values: Œ≤b for background events and Œ≤a ‚àí Œ¥ and Œ≤a + Œ¥, respectively, for triggered events below and above the magnitude of the triggering earthquake; the two last values express a correlation between the magnitudes of triggered events with that of the triggering earthquake, a feature so far absent in all proposed operational generalizations of the ETAS model. The ETAS model incorporating this kinked magnitude distribution provides by far the best description of seismic catalogs and could thus have the best forecasting potential. We speculate that the kinked magnitude distribution may result from the system tending to restore the symmetry of the regional displacement gradient tensor that has been broken by the initiating event. The general emerging concept could be that while the background events occur primarily to accommodate the symmetric stress tensor at the boundaries of the system, the triggered earthquakes are quasi-Goldstone fluctuations of a self-organized critical deformation state.},

Here we analyse the average size distribution of aftershocks of the recent Amatrice‚ÄìNorcia and Kumamoto earthquake sequences, and we suggest that in many cases it may be possible to discriminate whether an ongoing sequence represents a decaying aftershock sequence or foreshocks to an upcoming large event. We propose a simple traffic light classification to assess in real time the level of concern about a subsequent larger event and test it against 58 sequences, achieving a classification accuracy of 95 per cent.},

On land also, Mc can vary by one order of magnitude over distance less than 50 km. We recommend that seismicity studies that depend on complete sets of small earthquakes should be limited to areas with similar Mc, or the minimum magnitude for the analysis has to be raised to the highest common value of Mc. We believe that the data quality, as reflected by the Mc level, should be used to define the spatial extent of seismicity studies where Mc plays a role. The method we use calculates the goodness of fit between a power law fit to the data and the observed frequency-magnitude distribution as a function of a lower cutoff of the magnitude data. Mc is defined as the magnitude at which 90\% of the data can be modeled by a power law fit. Mc in the 1990s is approximately 1.2 ¬± 0.4 in most parts of California, 1.8 ¬± 0.4 in most of Alaska (Aleutians and Panhandle excluded), and at a higher level in the JUNEC catalog for Japan. Various sources, such as explosions and earthquake families beneath volcanoes, can lead to distributions that cannot be fit well by power laws. For the Hokkaido region we demonstrate how neglecting the spatial variability of Mc can lead to erroneous assumptions about deviations from self-similarity of earthquake scaling.},

	abstract = {The¬†majority of earthquakes occur unexpectedly and can trigger subsequent sequences of events that can culminate in more powerful earthquakes. This self-exciting nature of seismicity generates complex clustering of earthquakes in space and time. Therefore, the problem of constraining the magnitude of the largest expected earthquake during a future time interval is of critical importance in mitigating earthquake hazard. We address this problem by developing a methodology to compute the probabilities for such extreme earthquakes to be above certain magnitudes. We combine the Bayesian methods with the extreme value theory and assume that the occurrence of earthquakes can be described by the Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence process. We analyze in detail the application of this methodology to the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake sequence. We are able to estimate retrospectively the probabilities of having large subsequent earthquakes during several stages of the evolution of this sequence.},

	abstract = {The most common earthquake forecasting models assume that the magnitude of the next earthquake is independent from the past. This feature severely limits the capability to forecast large earthquakes with high probabilities. Here we investigate empirically on the magnitude-independence assumption, exploring if: (i) background and triggered earthquakes have the same frequency‚Äìmagnitude distribution, (ii) variations of seismicity in the space‚Äìtime‚Äìmagnitude domain encode some information on the future earthquakes size. For this purpose, and to verify the stability of the findings, we consider seismic catalogues covering different space‚Äìtime‚Äìmagnitude windows, such as the Alto Tiberina Near Fault Observatory (TABOO), the California and Japanese seismic catalogues. Our approach is inspired by the nearest-neighbour method proposed by Baiesi \&amp; Paczuski and elaborated by Zaliapin et¬†al. to distinguish between triggered and background earthquakes. Here we implement the same metric-based correlation to identify the precursory seismicity of any triggered earthquake; this allows us to analyse, for each triggered earthquake, the space‚Äìtime‚Äìmagnitude distribution of the seismicity that likely contributed to its occurrence. Our results show that the magnitude-independence assumption holds reasonably well in all catalogues, with a remarkable exception that is consistent with a previous independent study; this departure from the magnitude-independence assumption shows that larger events tend to nucleate at a higher distance from the ongoing sequence. We also notice that the reliability of this assumption may depend on the spatial scale considered; it holds for seismic catalogues of large areas, but we identify possible departures in small areas, reflecting different ways to release locally seismic energy. Finally, we come across an important issue that may lead to misleading results in similar studies, that is, if a seismic catalogue appears overall complete above a fixed magnitude threshold, it may still yield spurious signals into the analysis. Specifically, we show that some significant departures from the magnitude-independence assumption do not survive when considering spatiotemporal variations of the magnitude of completeness.},

	abstract = {An accumulation of seismic moment data gathered over the previous decade justifies a new attempt at a comprehensive statistical analysis of these data: herein, more rigourous statistical techniques are introduced, their properties investigated, and these methods are employed for analysis of large modern data sets. Several theoretical distributions of earthquake size (seismic moment‚Äìfrequency relations) are described and compared. We discuss the requirements for such distributions and introduce an upper bound or a ‚Äòcorner moment‚Äô for a distribution to have a finite energy or moment flux. We derive expressions for probability density functions and statistical moments of the distributions. We also describe parameter evaluation, in particular how to estimate the seismic moment distribution for the largest earthquakes. Simulating earthquake size distributions allows for a more rigourous evaluation of distribution parameters and points to the limitations of the classical statistical analysis of earthquake data. Simulations suggest that several earthquakes approaching or exceeding the corner magnitude (mc) limit need to be registered to evaluate mc with reasonable accuracy. Using the Harvard catalogue data, we compare moment distribution parameters for various temporal spans of the catalogue, for different tectonic provinces and depth ranges, and for earthquakes with various focal mechanisms. The statistical analysis suggests that the exponent Œ≤ is universal (Œ≤ = 0.60‚Äì0.65) for all moderate earthquakes. The corner moment (Mc) value, determined by the maximum-likelihood method, both in subduction zones and globally, is about 1021 N m, corresponding to the corner moment magnitude mc ‚âà 8.0. For mid-oceanic earthquakes, mc is apparently smaller for spreading ridges, it is about 5.8, and for strike-slip earthquakes on transform faults it decreases from 7.2 to 6.5 as the relative slip velocity of faults increases. We investigate the seismic moment errors, both random and systematic, and their dependence on earthquake size. The relative errors seem to decrease for larger events. The influence of moment uncertainties on the parameter estimates is studied. Whereas the Œ≤ values do not appear to be significantly influenced by the errors, for the corner moment large errors can lead to substantially biased estimates. We compare the Harvard catalogue results with the earthquake data from instrumental catalogues in the first three-quarters of the 20th century. Several very large earthquakes (m ‚â• 9) occurred around the middle of the century. Their magnitude values cannot be fitted by a modified Gutenberg‚ÄìRichter law with mc = 8.0‚Äì8.5. Among other factors, this discrepancy can be explained by either substantially higher errors in the earlier magnitude values, or by mc being higher for some subduction zones. It is unlikely that data available presently or soon will be sufficient to determine the corner magnitude of 9 and above, with reasonable precision, using purely statistical methods.},

	abstract = {To understand whether the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers earthquake changed the proximity to failure on the San Andreas fault system, we examine the general problem of how one earthquake might trigger another. The tendency of rocks to fail in a brittle manner is thought to be a function of both shear and confining stresses, commonly formulated as the Coulomb failure criterion. Here we explore how changes in Coulomb conditions associated with one or more earthquakes may trigger subsequent events. We first consider a Coulomb criterion appropriate for the production of aftershocks, where faults most likely to slip are those optimally orientated for failure as a result of the prevailing regional stress field and the stress change caused by the mainshock. We find that the distribution of aftershocks for the Landers earthquake, as well as for several other moderate events in its vicinity, can be explained by the Coulomb criterion as follows: aftershocks are abundant where the Coulomb stress on optimally orientated faults rose by more than one-half bar, and aftershocks are sparse where the Coulomb stress dropped by a similar amount. Further, we find that several moderate shocks raised the stress at the future Landers epicenter and along much of the Landers rupture zone by about a bar, advancing the Landers shock by 1 to 3 centuries. The Landers rupture, in turn, raised the stress at site of the future M = 6.5 Big Bear aftershock site by 3 bars. The Coulomb stress change on a specified fault is independent of regional stress but depends on the fault geometry, sense of slip, and the coefficient of friction. We use this method to resolve stress changes on the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults imposed by the Landers sequence. Together the Landers and Big Bear earthquakes raised the stress along the San Bernardino segment of the southern San Andreas fault by 2 to 6 bars, hastening the next great earthquake there by about a decade.},

I determine the parameters of the Omori and Gutenberg-Richter laws for aftershocks close in time to a mainshock. Aftershock sequences of large earthquakes in southern California (1952 Kern County, 1992 Joshua Tree-Landers-Big Bear sequence, 1994 Northridge, and 1999 Hector Mine), recorded in the CalTech catalog, are analyzed to demonstrate that at the beginning of these series, many small earthquakes are absent from the catalog. The number of missing earthquakes increases with the magnitude range of a catalog and for some data sets exceeds the number of aftershocks close to a mainshock listed in a catalog. Comparing global earthquake catalogs (Harvard Centroid Moment Tensor and Preliminary Determination of Epicenter) with local data sets indicates that the catalogs based on longer period waves miss many early aftershocks even when their magnitudes are well above the stated magnitude threshold. Such short-term incompleteness may introduce significant biases to the statistical analysis of the seismicity pattern, in particular for branching models of earthquake occurrence incorporating the Omori law. For such models the likelihood function strongly depends on close aftershocks. I review the techniques to alleviate this problem. Analyzing the source rupture process of several recent large earthquakes suggests that rupture propagation is highly inhomogeneous in space, time, and focal mechanism. These random variations in the rupture process can be viewed as an extension of the aftershock stochastic generating mechanism toward the origin time of a mainshock. I review various models of the earthquake rupture process and suggest that fractal distributions of microevents in time, space, and focal mechanism constitute the development of an earthquake.

	abstract = {We examine localization processes of low magnitude seismicity in relation to the occurrence of large earthquakes using three complementary analyses: (i) estimated production of rock damage by background events, (ii) evolving occupied fractional area of background seismicity and (iii) progressive coalescence of individual earthquakes into clusters. The different techniques provide information on different time scales and on the spatial extent of weakened damaged regions. Techniques (i) and (ii) use declustered catalogues to avoid the occasional strong fluctuations associated with aftershock sequences, while technique (iii) examines developing clusters in entire catalogue data. We analyse primarily earthquakes around large faults that are locked in the interseismic periods, and examine also as a contrasting example seismicity from the creeping Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault. Results of analysis (i) show that the M \&gt;¬†7 Landers 1992, Hector Mine 1999, El Mayor-Cucapah 2010 and Ridgecrest 2019 main shocks in Southern and Baja California were preceded in the previous decades by generation of rock damage around the eventual rupture zones. Analysis (ii) reveals localization (reduced fractional area) 2‚Äì3¬†yr before these main shocks and before the M \&gt;¬†7 D√ºzce 1999 earthquake in Turkey. Results with technique (iii) indicate that individual events tend to coalesce rapidly to clusters in the final 1‚Äì2¬†yr before the main shocks. Corresponding analyses of data from the Parkfield region show opposite delocalization patterns and decreasing clustering before the 2004 M6 earthquake. Continuing studies with these techniques, combined with analysis of geodetic data and insights from laboratory experiments and model simulations, might improve the ability to track preparation processes leading to large earthquakes.},

Forecasts of the probability of aftershocks can therefore aid decision-making during earthquake response and recovery. Several countries issue authoritative aftershock forecasts. Most aftershock forecasts are based on simple statistical models that were first developed in the 1980s and remain the best available models. We review these statistical models and the wide-ranging research to advance aftershock forecasting through better statistical, physical, and machine-learning methods. Physics-based forecasts based on mainshock stress changes can sometimes match the statistical models in testing but do not yet outperform them. Physical models are also hampered by unsolved problems such as the mechanics of dynamic triggering and the influence of background conditions. Initial work on machine-learning forecasts shows promise, and new machine-learning earthquake catalogs provide an opportunity to advance all types of aftershock forecasts. ‚ñ™Several countries issue real-time aftershock forecasts following significant earthquakes, providing information to aid response and recovery. ‚ñ™Statistical models based on past aftershocks are used to compute aftershock probability as a function of space, time, and magnitude. ‚ñ™Aftershock forecasting is advancing through better statistical models, constraints on physical triggering mechanisms, and machine learning. ‚ñ™Large high-resolution earthquake catalogs provide an opportunity to advance physical, statistical, and machine-learning aftershock models.

	abstract = {Point processes have been dominant in modeling the evolution of seismicity for decades, with the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model being most popular. Recent advances in machine learning have constructed highly flexible point process models using neural networks to improve upon existing parametric models. We investigate whether these flexible point process models can be applied to short-term seismicity forecasting by extending an existing temporal neural model to the magnitude domain and we show how this model can forecast earthquakes above a target magnitude threshold. We first demonstrate that the neural model can fit synthetic ETAS data, however, requiring less computational time because it is not dependent on the full history of the sequence. By artificially emulating short-term aftershock incompleteness in the synthetic data set, we find that the neural model outperforms ETAS. Using a new enhanced catalog from the 2016‚Äì2017 Central Apennines earthquake sequence, we investigate the predictive skill of ETAS and the neural model with respect to the lowest input magnitude. Constructing multiple forecasting experiments using the Visso, Norcia and Campotosto earthquakes to partition training and testing data, we target M3+ events. We find both models perform similarly at previously explored thresholds (e.g., above M3), but lowering the threshold to M1.2 reduces the performance of ETAS unlike the neural model. We argue that some of these gains are due to the neural model's ability to handle incomplete data. The robustness to missing data and speed to train the neural model present it as an encouraging competitor in earthquake forecasting.},

The national‚Äêscale differences between the new and earlier NSHM appear less than those seen between much earlier national models, indicating that some degree of consistency has been achieved in the national‚Äêscale pattern of hazard estimates, at least for return periods of 475¬†years and greater.Online Material: Table of fault source parameters for the 2010 national seismic‚Äêhazard model.},

This variability is particularly concerning for large earthquakes where the number of aftershocks varies by factors of 100 for mainshocks of comparable magnitude. Do observable factors lead to differences in aftershock behavior? We examine aftershock productivity relative to the global average for all mainshocks ( ) from 1990 to 2019. A global map of earthquake productivity highlights the influence of tectonic regimes. Earthquake depth, lithosphere age, and plate boundary type correspond well with earthquake productivity. We investigate the role of mainshock attributes by compiling source dimensions, radiated seismic energy, stress drop, and a measure of slip heterogeneity based on finite-fault source inversions for the largest earthquakes from 1990 to 2017. On an individual basis, stress drop, normalized rupture width, and aspect ratio most strongly correlate with aftershock productivity. A multivariate analysis shows that a particular set of parameters (dip, lithospheric age, and normalized rupture area) combines well to improve predictions of aftershock productivity on a cross-validated data set. Our overall analysis is consistent with a model in which the volumetric abundance of nearby stressed faults controls the aftershock productivity rather than variations in source stress. Thus, we suggest a complementary approach to aftershock forecasts based on geological and rupture properties rather than local calibration alone.},

	abstract = {The Omori formula n(t)=K(t+c)-1 and its modified form n(t)=K(t+c)-P have been successfully applied to many aftershock sequences since the former was proposed just 100 years ago. This paper summarizes studies using these formulae. The problems of fitting these formulae and related point process models to observational data are discussed mainly. Studies published during the last 1/3 century confirmed that the modified Omori formula generally provides an appropriate representation of the temporal variation of aftershock activity. Although no systematic dependence of the index p has been found on the magnitude of the main shock and on the lowest limit of magnitude above which aftershocks are counted, this index (usually p = 0.9-1.5) differs from sequence to. sequence. This variability may be related to the tectonic condition of the region such as structural heterogeneity, stress, and temperature, but it is not clear which factor is most significant in controlling the p value. The constant c is a controversial quantity. It is strongly influenced by incomplete detection of small aftershocks in the early stage of sequence. Careful analyses indicate that c is positive at least for some sequences. Point process models for the temporal pattern of shallow seismicity must include the existence of aftershocks, most suitably expressed by the modified Omori law. Among such models, the ETAS model seems to best represent the main features of seismicity with only five parameters. An anomalous decrease in aftershock activity below the level predicted by the modified Omori formula sometimes precedes a large aftershock. An anomalous decrease in seismic activity of a region below the level predicted by the ETAS model is sometimes followed by a large earthquake in the same or in a neighboring region.},

In the last decades, two opposite answers have been given to the problem of correlation of magnitudes: there is no correlation, that is the magnitude of earthquakes in a seismic catalogue can be considered as random sampling from the magnitude distribution; or, there is a correlation, that is the magnitude of a seismic event can influence the magnitude of the successive event. Here we used the Southern California seismic catalogue, properly treated to remove incompleteness, to answer the question, finding no significant correlation between magnitudes.},

Magnitude clustering is not currently implemented in earthquake forecasting but would be important if larger magnitude events are more likely to be followed by similar sized events. Here we show statistically significant magnitude clustering present in many different field and laboratory catalogs at a wide range of spatial scales (mm to 1000‚Äâkm). It is universal in field catalogs across fault types and tectonic/induced settings, while laboratory results are unaffected by loading protocol or rock types and show temporal stability. The absence of clustering can be imposed by a global tensile stress, although clustering still occurs when isolating to triggered event pairs or spatial patches where shear stress dominates. Magnitude clustering is most prominent at short time and distance scales and modeling indicates {\textgreater}20\% repeating magnitudes in some cases, implying it can help to narrow physical mechanisms for seismogenesis.},

	abstract = {The distribution of the magnitudes of seismic events is generally assumed to be independent on past seismicity. However, by considering events in causal relation, for example, mother-daughter, it seems natural to assume that the magnitude of a daughter event is conditionally dependent on one of the corresponding mother events. In order to find experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis, we analyze different catalogs, both real and simulated, in two different ways. From each catalog, we obtain the law of the magnitude of the triggered events by kernel density. The results obtained show that the distribution density of the magnitude of the triggered events varies with the magnitude of their corresponding mother events. As the intuition suggests, an increase of the magnitude of the mother events induces an increase of the probability of having ‚Äúhigh‚Äù values of the magnitude of the triggered events. In addition, we see a statistically significant increasing linear dependence of the magnitude means.},

	abstract = {A crucial point in the debate on the feasibility of earthquake predictions is the dependence of an earthquake magnitude from past seismicity. Indeed, while clustering in time and space is widely accepted, much more questionable is the existence of magnitude correlations. The standard approach generally assumes that magnitudes are independent and therefore in principle unpredictable. Here we show the existence of clustering in magnitude: earthquakes occur with higher probability close in time, space, and magnitude to previous events. More precisely, the next earthquake tends to have a magnitude similar but smaller than the previous one. A dynamical scaling relation between magnitude, time, and space distances reproduces the complex pattern of magnitude, spatial, and temporal correlations observed in experimental seismic catalogs.},
